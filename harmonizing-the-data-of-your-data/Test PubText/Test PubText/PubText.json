        "INTRO": "INTRODUCTION\nThe flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to proteins is the \u201ccentral dogma\u201d of molecular biology. Global analysis and annotation of these biomolecules in cells is one of the ultimate goals in analytical biochemistry. Although whole genome and transcriptome can now be analyzed by advanced next-generation sequencing technology, it is still not clear whether some DNA sequences truly encode proteins, such as short open reading frames. As to the individual human being, the proteome is shaped by personalized genome containing genetic DNA polymorphism and sporadic mutations. In cancer patients, up to thousands of DNA mutations can be detected in tumor cells. A recurring question is whether these mutations are transcribed and translated into proteins. Furthermore, instead of one gene-one protein hypothesis, the proteome is greatly enlarged by alternative RNA splicing and alternative translation. For example, in repeat-associated non-ATG translation, homopolymeric proteins in three reading frames can be unexpectedly expressed from numerous expanded repeat mutations (e.g. CAG, CGG and GGGGCC) that are linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, many protein forms in cells may be missing in commonly used protein reference databases.\nProteogenomics is an emerging approach to enhance the annotation of genome and proteome, often relying on next-generation sequencing and deep mass spectrometry (MS) data. Indeed, the approach is initially designed by proteomics pioneers for interpreting reference genomes. With the development of genome-wide sequencing techniques, genomics variant sequence information (e.g., DNA polymorphisms and alternative splicing) has been rapidly accumulated and incorporated into customized database to identify protein variants. But genome-wide proteomics studies had been difficult until recent improvement in the depth of MS-based proteomics.\nProteogenomics pipeline usually includes multiple steps, such as customized database construction, database search, peptide-spectrum match (PSM) filtering, novel peptide identification and visualization. The whole process can be laborious and error-prone. A number of computational methods have been proposed for generating customized database in recent years, which can be classified into three categories: (i) DNA polymorphism/mutation (hereafter using \u201cmutation\u201d for simplicity) database, (ii) splice junction database, and (iii) genome/transcriptome six-frame translation (6FT) database for detecting non-canonical translation events in unknown coding DNA sequence regions. However, most of these studies do not address peptides in all categories simultaneously. Hence, we attempt to include all possible novel peptides derived from genomic and transcriptomic data in the customized database in an effective and efficient way.\nAnother challenge in proteogenomics study is how to overcome the effect of database size (i.e. search space). Whereas enlarging customized database potentially increases the chance of true PSMs, it also raises an associated probability that MS/MS spectra are wrongly matched to peptides, especially when the majority of sequences in the search space are false (e.g. in whole genome 6FT database). One effective solution is to use multistage database search strategy, in which MS/MS spectra are first searched against a well-annotated database (e.g. UniProt), and then the unmatched spectra are explored by searching large but less confident search space. In this way, most true PSMs are obtained at the first stage of analysis, and further increased by subsequent stage(s). To be more efficient, this multistage process can be further accelerated by removing low quality spectra before the second stage of analysis. Low quality spectra could be readily discriminated by amino acid tags extracted from the spectra. However, these advanced techniques have not been applied in the majority of proteogenomics studies. In addition, most existing proteogenomics tools are not well integrated for high usability.\nHere we present JUMPg, a computational pipeline that automates complex proteogenomics analysis. The program provides customized database methods from all three categories; supports multistage analysis to maximize peptide identification, and exhibits detected peptides/proteins in the UCSC genome browser. For high sensitivity and accuracy, the JUMP algorithm is implemented to produce high quality tag information for assessing MS/MS spectrum quality and performing database search. Application of JUMPg in two deep proteomics datasets revealed a variety of sample-specific peptides/proteins in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) brain and multiple myeloma (MM) cells. The JUMPg software, source code and documentation are freely available (https://github.com/gatechatl/JUMPg).",
        "RESULTS": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nImproved Peptide Identification by Multistage Customized Databases and Partially Tryptic Search\nThe JUMPg program implements three independent methods for constructing customized peptide databases including mutations, splice junctions and RNA-seq 6FT translated peptides (Figure 1). While mutations and splice junctions focus on variant peptides in annotated CDS regions, there is emerging evidence for functional proteins encoded by unknown open reading frames. Therefore JUMPg constructs another database by RNA-seq de novo assembly and six frame translation (Figure 2). This method shows the best balance between database comprehensiveness (the whole transcriptome) and specificity (compact search space), compared to whole genome translation (Supporting Information Note, Table S2 and Figure S3). As to search space, the mutation, splice junction and 6FT databases are equivalent to 1.1%, 3.0% and 71.4% of fully tryptic UniProt protein database (default reference database), respectively (Table 1). In addition, whole proteome data often contain a significant amount of partially tryptic peptides possibly due to endogenous protease activities. The partially tryptic database is ~10 times larger than the fully tryptic counterpart.\nTo increase the search efficiency against these databases (Figure S4 in Supporting Information), a multistage strategy is developed to perform the analysis sequentially (Figure 1A). First, the MS/MS spectra are matched to a fully tryptic peptide database pooled from UniProt, mutations and splice junctions. The matching results are filtered to ~1% false discovery rate at protein level. Then only the unmatched high quality spectra are subjected to the 2nd stage of analysis against the large partially tryptic database. Moreover, this partially tryptic database is shrunk by considering proteins only identified in the 1st stage (Table S3 in Supporting Information). Finally, the remaining high quality spectra are searched against the 6FT database, as the majority of the peptides inside are false owing to six frame translation.\nJUMPg exports the identified peptides in a text table, showing the peptide sequences, PSM counts, tags and scores of the best PSM, and database entries (Figure 1B). JUMPg also provides a visualization function by converting peptides to genomic locations via UCSC known gene annotations, which can be co-displayed with other genomic information on the UCSC genome browser (Figure 1C). For example, two novel peptides (in magenta) were identified to indicate an event of intron retention, whereas another peptide (in green) was also identified to support the canonical protein isoform, annotated with known transcript (in navy) of the CASKIN1 gene in chromosome 16. Taken together, JUMPg maximizes novel peptide identification by three different customized database methods in an effective manner, and displays results for integrative visualization.\nAcceleration of Multistage Database Search by Spectrum Quality Control and Amino Acid Tag Recycling\nTo reduce multistage database search time, we discard low quality spectra before the 2nd stage analysis, based on MS/MS spectrum quality. To calculate a quality score for each spectrum, we use three features, spectrum intensity, total peak number, and the best tag length. All three features are highly correlated with PSM identification successful rate defined by accepted PSMs in the 1st stage analysis (Figure 3A), consistent with previous reports. Of these, the tag length (in black) shows the best performance by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (Figure 3B). To maximize the discriminant capacity, we use the LDA method to combine these features into one single quality score (in red), which outperforms any individual feature (Figure 3B). Next, a threshold of the quality score is selected to balance the removal of MS/MS spectra and the recovery of high quality spectra, depending on the score distribution and the accumulative curve of accepted PSMs in the 1st stage analysis (Figure 3C). When preserving 99% of accepted PSMs, the threshold is able to eliminate ~35% of the MS/MS spectra. As database search time is linearly correlated with the spectrum number, this filtering step can save ~35% of computational time (Figure S4C in Supporting Information).\nTo further improve database search speed, JUMPg implements a novel function by recycling amino acid tags of each MS/MS spectrum. The tag information enables high sensitivity and accuracy of peptide identification, but the process to derive tags is time-consuming. The tags generated at the 1st stage analysis are recorded and re-used in the 2nd and later stage analysis, which further accelerate database search by ~25%. Taken together, the spectrum quality control and tag recycling reduce search time by more than 50% for multistage analysis.\nWe also considered one potential caveat of multistage analysis, in which PSMs accepted in the 1st stage could have higher scores in the 2nd or 3rd stage. To address this, more than 156,000 MS/MS spectra were searched against fully tryptic database, resulting in 52,114 accepted PSMs (1% FDR). These spectra were re-searched against partially tryptic database, leading to higher scores of only 97 (0.2% out of 52,114) PSMs. This small percentage is lower than the specified FDR level (1%). Thus, the multistage strategy saves database search time by omitting PSMs accepted in the 1st stage, which does not introduce extra false positives of PSMs.\nApplication to Label Free Data: Discovery of a Novel Protein Coding Gene in Human Brain\nWe previously analyzed Alzheimer\u2019s disease brain proteome by long gradient LC/LC-MS/MS and the transcriptome by RNA sequencing, identifying ~10,000 reference proteins. However, the sample-specific events such as DNA polymorphisms and brain specific alternative splicing events have not been addressed. Here we used the JUMPg pipeline to analyze the same dataset (dataset 1 with ~1.7 million label free MS/MS spectra), discovering a total of 496 novel peptides in three stage analyses (Table 1). These 496 novel peptides are classified into 14 types of events (Table 2), including amino acid substitution, deletion, frame shift, exon skipping and other alternative splicing events, as well as translation from antisense strand, non-coding genes, untranslated regions (UTR) and intergenic regions. Four examples are illustrated in detail (Figure 4): (i) a single amino acid substitution in ACO2 supported by three peptides, (ii) an in-frame deletion of PRUNE2, (iii) an exon skipping in SLC12A5, and (iv) 5\u2032 UTR translation / alternative start codon demonstrated by the original and Met oxidized forms of a fully tryptic peptide.\nAs a high percentage of mutated peptides identified in proteogenomics studies are also found in public single nucleotide polymorphism database (dbSNP), we analyzed in this sample the 255 novel single-amino acid substitution events, and found that 239 (94%) are collected in the dbSNP (version 138). This consistent result provides additional support to the confidence of JUMPg-identified novel peptides.\nInterestingly, we uncovered a novel protein coding gene specifically expressed in the human brain. During the 3rd stage analysis with the 6FT database, we found nine novel peptides that locate within a 1.5 kb region of chromosome X (Figure 5A, 5B), a genomic region with no protein coding gene models recorded in databases (including refSeq, UCSC, GENCODE v19, Ensembl v75 and AceView). Closer examination of these nine peptides (in magenta) confirmed that they share the same open reading frame, suggesting that these peptides are translated from one novel protein coding gene. To obtain the full protein sequence of this new gene, we aligned the assembled RNA transcripts to the reference genome, translated this genomic region according to the reading frame defined by JUMPg-identified peptides, and derived 578 amino acid protein sequence (in green, Figure S4 in Supporting Information).\nTo functionally annotate this novel protein, the sequence was aligned to NCBI non-redundant protein database. The top hit was a computationally predicted protein termed \u201cputative paraneoplastic antigen-like protein 6B-like protein (PNMA6BL)\u201d in a primate (Cercocebus atys) with 86% identity. Moreover, one \u201cPNMA\u201d domain was identified by Pfam within the novel protein sequence, suggesting that this protein belongs to the paraneoplastic antigens Ma (PNMA) gene family. In human, this family includes 7 known members (PNMA1, 2, 3, 5, 6A and PNMAL1, 2). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that this novel protein was clustered within the PNMA6 sub-branch (Figure 5C), consistent with its homologue in the primate. Thus, we named this novel protein as \u201cPNMA6BL\u201d. In addition, pan-tissue RNA-seq analysis indicates that the PNMA6BL gene is almost exclusively expressed in human brain (Figure 5D), which is typical for the PNMA gene family. This example demonstrates that our JUMPg pipeline allows the identification of previously unannotated genes by combining deep proteomics and transcriptomics data.\nApplication to Isotopically labeled Data: Identification of Immunoglobulin Light Chain Variable Region Peptide in Multiple Myeloma Cells\nIsobaric labeling techniques (e.g. iTRAQ/TMT) have been widely used in quantitative proteomics, but peptide identification is more challenging due to noise peaks induced by labeling reagents. To further test the performance of JUMPg, we applied the same procedure (Figure 1A) to a large TMT dataset (dataset 2 with 6.2 million MS/MS spectra) from multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines. Intriguingly, we observed a high percentage of partially tryptic peptides in this dataset (Table 1), with 67,368 partially tryptic peptides (33% of total peptides) from 182,988 PSMs (20% of total PSMs). As MM cells are known to produce a high level of immunoglobulin, cell survival relies on excessive proteasome activity, which might explain the presence of additional partially tryptic peptides. Similarly, high frequency of partial trypticity was also detected in human serum, suggesting that in vivo proteases may be linked to this elevated partial cleavage.\nIn the three stage analyses, we accepted 198,103 peptides from 909,223 PSMs (Table 1). As expected, the PSM identification successful rate of the TMT dataset (18%) is lower than that of the label free AD dataset (36%). Nonetheless, we determined a total of 991 novel peptides, which were summarized into 531 mutation, 158 novel splicing and 48 non-canonical translation events (Table 2). Notably, the most abundant peptide matched by 211 PSMs displays three substitutions in the immunoglobulin light chain variable region (Figure 6). The result exemplifies the advantage of the 6FT method, in which bona fide RNA information is retained in the 6FT database. Because the immunoglobulin light chain variable region is unique to individual B cell clones, the capability of identifying these unique peptides highlights JUMPg as a potential tool towards personalized proteome.",

        "METHODS": "EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\nThe JUMPg algorithm takes as input MS raw data, commonly used protein database (e.g. UniProt), and corresponding genomics data (e.g. mutations detected by next-generation sequencing, RNA-seq raw data and derived splice junctions and assembled transcripts), and outputs identified peptides/proteins with annotations. There are five modules in the algorithm (Figure 1 and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).\nModule 1: Customized Database Construction\nJUMPg provides three options of constructing customized databases (Figure 2), including mutations, splice junctions, and non-canonical translation from all six frames.\nMutation peptides are directly input by genomic variant files (e.g. VCF files) or indirectly derived from RNA-seq raw data (FASTAQ file). RNA reads are aligned to human reference genome (hg19) by STAR with UCSC gene annotations. Mutations are detected by GATK following the \u201cGATK Best Practices\u201d protocol, stored in VCF format, and classified by AnnoVar (version 23, August 2013) into different functional categories (e.g. non-silent, intronic, intergenic, etc.). Amino acid (AA) sequences that flank (\u00b130 AAs) non-silent mutations are extracted according to UCSC gene annotations into FASTA format.\nSplice junction database is generated with a similar strategy described by Sheynkman et al. 2013. Splice junction peptides are input by junction files from the STAR program, and filtered with following criteria: i) at least 2 uniquely mapped reads, and ii) containing canonical splice sites (GT/AG, GC/AG, or AT/AC). The two genomic sequence fragments that flank a pair of splice donor and acceptor sites are retrieved from reference genome, and translated in three open reading frames (ORFs). If the ORF contains a stop codon, the sequence is trimmed. If the stop codon locates upstream of the splice site, the sequence is discarded because no novel amino acid sequence is produced.\nNon-canonical translated peptides are made from RNA-seq reads through all 6 frames. RNAseq reads are first assembled into transcripts using trinity (version 2.1.1)  with default parameters (Supporting Information Notes). Each transcript is then translated in 6 frames, split by stop codons and only ORFs with at least 66 AAs (i.e., ~200 bp) are retained.\nModule 2: Database Search\nOur tag-based database search engine JUMP  was modified to adapt multistage strategy and maintain regular search function (version 13.1.0). In the regular search, JUMP performs preprocessing, tag generation, MS/MS pattern matching and scoring as previously reported, and outputs two temporary files: a DTAS file containing mass-corrected and intensity-normalized MS/MS peak information, and a TAGS file containing de novo tags for each MS/MS scan. We evaluated MS/MS quality by the two files and kept only unmatched high quality spectra for multistage analysis (see Module 5). In addition, we also used these files to bypass two time-consuming steps (preprocessing and tag generation) during the multistage analysis, which is termed tag recycling. Common parameters include \u00b16 ppm for precursor ion mass tolerance, dynamic mass shift for oxidized Met (+15.9949 Da), and the consideration of a, b, and y ions. Fixed modifications on the N termini and Lys (+229.1629 Da) are also included for the TMT dataset.\nModule 3: Peptide-spectrum Match Filtering\nThe peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) are filtered as previously reported. The target-decoy strategy is used to evaluate false discovery rate. PSMs are first filtered by user-specified parameters (e.g. minimal peptide length and minimum search score), then by precursor ion mass accuracy. The resulting PSMs are further grouped by precursor ion charge state, tryptic ends, and then filtered by matching scores (Jscore and \u0394Jscore) to achieve the user-specified level of false discovery rate.\nModule 4: Peptide Annotation and Visualization\nAccepted peptides from mutation or junction search space are examined respectively for the specific amino acid(s) mutated or that span the splicing junction. The survived peptides are condensed into events (e.g., by collapsing different modification forms), with genomic positions stored in BED format for visualization in the UCSC genome browser.\nFor peptides identified from RNA 6FT database, peptides from known search space are first removed and the corresponding RNA transcripts are aligned to reference genome (hg19) by BLAT (v36, default parameters). Top-scored alignment result for each transcript is retained from which the genomic position of each peptide is derived. Peptides are further classified according to UCSC gene annotations. In case one peptide can be assigned to multiple isoforms, the following priority will be applied: CDS > UTR > intron > non-coding genes > intergenic regions. Peptides that cannot be mapped to human genome are currently not considered.\nModule 5: Spectrum Quality Scoring\nThe quality of tandem MS spectra is scored by the method of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with modification, using the 1st stage database search result as a training set. The method integrates features reflecting tag information (i.e. the top tag length) and spectrum data (i.e. square root of MS2 peak number and logarithm transformed MS2 maximum peak intensity) by the equation:  \nWhere fi and ci denote value and coefficient of each feature, respectively. The coefficients are obtained by training the LDA model. The threshold of spectrum quality score is adjusted to allow discarding less than 1% of accepted PSMs.\nTo evaluate whether the LDA method introduced overfitting during the analysis, we performed 10-fold cross validation analysis in the following steps: i) the whole dataset was randomly partitioned into 10 equal sized subsamples; ii) of these 10 subsamples, 9 subsamples were used for training the LDA model and deriving a training receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, while the remaining subsample was used as the testing data for a testing ROC curve; iii) we repeated the 2nd step for 10 times to evaluate the variation of the analysis. If overfitting occurred, the area under ROC curve (AUC) of the training dataset would be larger than that of the independent testing dataset. Our results showed that the training and testing AUCs were nearly identical (Table S4 in Supporting Information), indicating no overfitting of LDA modeling in our analysis.\nData Analysis of Two Large Dataset (AD and MM cells)\nThe first dataset was collected from human Alzheimer\u2019s disease postmortem brain, including label-free high resolution MS raw data (1.7 million MS/MS scans) and RNA-seq data (50 million reads; Table S1 in Supporting Information). The second dataset was obtained from a multiple myeloma cell line (ANBL6), including tandem mass tag (TMT, Thermo Fisher Scientific) labeled raw data (6.2 million MS/MS scans) and RNA-seq data (242 million reads).\nProteogenomics analysis was performed by JUMPg in three stages. i) MS data were searched against a database combining mutations and splice junction peptides as well as UniProt human proteins (downloaded in February 2015) with fully tryptic restriction. The resulting PSMs in the 1st stage were filtered to 1% unique protein FDR. ii) Partially tryptic search was carried out with the unmatched high quality spectra against proteins accepted during the 1st stage. iii) The remaining spectra were matched to RNA-seq 6FT database, and filtered to 0% FDR. However, we recognized that the FDR estimation may not be accurate and further calculated the standard deviation of the FDR by previously reported method. The actual FDR falls between 0% and 0.2% within a 99% confidence interval. Moreover, we compared peptides identified from novel search space with those from reference database, and found that all peptides showed highly similar distributions of matching score, precursor mass error and tag length (Figure S2 in Supporting Information), indicating that our stringent filtering yielded high quality PSMs in novel search space.",

        "METHODS": "Experimental design, materials, and methods\nMaterial\nBovine raw tank milk was collected from clinically healthy cows, which were all housed on the Wageningen University farm (Wageningen, Netherlands).\nHeat treatment\nMilk fat was removed from the raw unheated milk by centrifuging milk at 1500\u00d7g for 20 minutes at 4\u00a0\u00b0C (with rotor 16.250, Avanti Centrifuge J-26 XP, Beckman Coulter, USA). After that, 50 ml of the unheated skim milk samples was heated at 65\u00a0\u00b0C, 70\u00a0\u00b0C, 75\u00a0\u00b0C, 80\u00a0\u00b0C or 85\u00a0\u00b0C, in triplicate, for 30 min, in a water bath. After this heat treatment, samples were cooled with ice water to room temperature before further analysis was conducted.\nNative whey protein preparation\nCasein and denatured proteins were removed from the skim milk samples by acidification and ultracentrifugation according to a previous paper. The pH of all heated skim milk samples was adjusted to 4.6. This causes a precipitation of the casein together with the denatured/aggregated whey proteins. After equilibrating the acidified samples at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 30 min, the samples were ultracentrifuged at 100,000\u00d7g for 90 min at 30\u00a0\u00b0C (with rotor 70 Ti, Beckman L-60, Beckman Coulter, USA). After ultracentrifugation, the top layer contained some traces of milk fat, whereas the micellar casein with the denatured/aggregated whey proteins were present in the pellet in the bottom of the tube. The supernatant, which is including the native whey proteins, was in the middle layer of the ultracentrifugation tube. This supernatant fraction was collected for further analysis.\nProteomics analysis\nThe Filter Aided Sample Preparation (FASP) method was carried out according to published articles. Native whey protein samples of 20 \u03bcL (with 116\u2013200 \u03bcg protein) were diluted in 180 \u03bcL SDT-lysis buffer (100 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0\u00a0+\u00a04% SDS\u00a0+\u00a00.1 M dithiothreitol) to get an approximately 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcL protein solution. After incubation at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 10 min, samples were centrifuged at 13524\u00d7g for 10 min in an Eppendorf 5424 centrifuge (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The centrifuged samples were cooled down to room temperature. Then, 20 \u03bcL (11.6\u201320 \u03bcg protein) of the sample in the SDT buffer was mixed with 180 \u03bcL 0.05 M IAA (Iodoacetamide)/UT (100 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0\u00a0+\u00a08 M urea) in a low binding Eppendorf tube. This sample was then incubated for 10 min while mild shaking at room temperature. Part of the sample (100 \u03bcL, containing 5.8\u201310 \u03bcg protein) was transferred to a Pall 3K omega filter (10\u201320 kDa cutoff, OD003C34; Pall, Washington, NY, USA) and the filter was then centrifuged at 13524\u00d7g for 30 min. The same centrifugation step was repeated three more times after adding 100 \u03bcL UT. After this centrifugation with UT, 110 \u03bcL 0.05 M ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) was added to the filter unit and centrifuged at 13524\u00d7g for 30 min. The filter was then transferred to a new low-binding Eppendorf tube, after which 100 \u03bcL\u00a0ABC containing 0.5 \u03bcg trypsin was added. The tube with filter was centrifuged at 13524\u00d7g for 30 min after incubation for 2 hours at 45\u00a0\u00b0C. The tryptic peptides were in this way collected in the low-binding tubes. Finally, 4\u20136 \u03bcL 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added to the tryptic peptides to adjust the pH to around 2 for LC-MS/MS analysis.\nThe LC-MS/MS parameters are the same as described previously. First, 18 \u03bcL of the trypsin-digested peptides was injected onto a 0.10 \u2217 30 mm Magic C18AQ 200A 5 \u03bcm beads (Michrom Bioresources Inc., USA) pre-concentration column (prepared in house) at a maximum pressure of 800\u00a0bar. Peptides were eluted from the pre-concentration column onto a 0.10 \u2217 200 mm ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ 1.9 \u03bcm beads analytical column with an acetonitrile gradient at a flow of 0.5 \u03bcL/min, using gradient elution from 8% to 33% acetonitrile in water with 0.5 v/v % acetic acid in 50 min. The column was washed using an increase in the percentage acetonitrile to 80% (with 20% water and 0.5 v/v % acetic acid in the acetonitrile and water) in 3 min. Between the pre-concentration and analytical column, an electrospray potential of 3.5 kV was applied directly to the eluent a stainless steel needle fitted into the waste line of the micro cross. Full scan positive mode FTMS spectra between m/z 380 and 1400 were measured on an LTQ-Orbitrap XL (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA, USA). CID-fragmented MSMS scans of the four most abundant doubly- and triply-charged peaks in the FTMS scan were recorded in data-dependent mode in the linear trap (MSMS threshold\u00a0=\u00a05.000).\nFor protein identification and quantification, each run with all MSMS spectra obtained was analyzed with Maxquant 1.6.0.1 with the Andromeda search engine. The digestion of enzyme was set as trypsin. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a fixed modification, and Oxidation of methionine, N-terminal acetylation and de-amidation of asparagine or glutamine were set as variable modifications. The bovine (taxonomy ID: 9913) reference database for peptide and protein searches was downloaded as fasta file from Uniprot with reverse sequences generated by Maxquant. All fasta files were downloaded from http://www.uniprot.org/(accessed Dec 2013). A set of 31 protein sequences of common contaminants was used as well, which included Trypsin (P00760, bovine), Trypsin (P00761, porcine), Keratin K22E (P35908, human), Keratin K1C9 (P35527, human), Keratin K2C1 (P04264, human), and Keratin K1C1 (P35527, human). A maximum of two missed cleavages were allowed, and a mass deviation of 0.5 Da for fragment MS/MS peaks and 20\u00a0ppm and 4.5\u00a0ppm for the peptide MS peaks during the first and main search, respectively. The false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1% on both peptide and protein level. The length of peptides was set to at least seven amino acids. Finally, proteins were identified based on minimally 2 distinct peptides of which at least one unique and at least one unmodified. The intensity based absolute quantification (iBAQ) algorithm calculates the sum of all peptide intensities divided by the number of theoretically observable tryptic peptides.\nThe relevant MS data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via PRIDE with the identifier PXD016436.",

        "TITLE": "Inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system by an NQO1-activatable compound",
        "ABSTRACT": "Malignant cells display an increased sensitivity towards drugs that reduce the function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which is the primary proteolytic system for destruction of aberrant proteins. Here, we report on the discovery of the bioactivatable compound CBK77, which causes an irreversible collapse of the UPS, accompanied by a general accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins and caspase-dependent cell death. CBK77 caused accumulation of ubiquitin-dependent, but not ubiquitin-independent, reporter substrates of the UPS, suggesting a selective effect on ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. In a genome-wide CRISPR interference screen, we identified the redox enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) as a critical mediator of CBK77 activity, and further demonstrated its role as the compound bioactivator. Through affinity-based proteomics, we found that CBK77 covalently interacts with ubiquitin. In vitro experiments showed that CBK77-treated ubiquitin conjugates were less susceptible to disassembly by deubiquitylating enzymes. In vivo efficacy of CBK77 was validated by reduced growth of NQO1-proficient human adenocarcinoma cells in nude mice treated with CBK77. This first-in-class NQO1-activatable UPS inhibitor suggests that it may be possible to exploit the intracellular environment in malignant cells for leveraging the impact of compounds that impair the UPS.",
        "INTRO": "Introduction\nProteotoxic stress is a condition that is observed in many cancer types and can be capitalized in anticancer regimens. The underlying causes of proteotoxic stress in malignant cells are multifactorial and inherently linked to their hyperactive state, such as an overall increase in protein synthesis and accumulation of aberrant and orphan proteins due to the loss of genome integrity. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the primary proteolytic system in charge of the timely and efficient degradation of aberrant and excessive proteins that are at risk of polluting the intracellular milieu. In malignant cells, the UPS is close to the limits of its maximal capacity and hence its operational efficiency is of critical importance for their survival. The increased demand for clearance of misfolded proteins generates a therapeutic window at which reduction of UPS activity is lethal for cancer cells without severely affecting protein homeostasis in healthy cells. To date, three proteasome inhibitors have been clinically approved for treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Despite the overall success of proteasome inhibitors in the treatment of hematological malignancies, several remaining challenges, such as adverse side effects, drug resistance, and poor activity towards solid tumors, motivate the exploration of alternative approaches for inhibiting UPS activity.\nProper functioning of the UPS involves hundreds of proteins, many of which display apparent druggable enzymatic activities. Recent efforts have focused on the development of compounds that inhibit deubiquitylating (DUB) enzymes, the ubiquitin-selective unfoldase p97/valosin containing protein (VCP), enzymes involved in ubiquitylation, or ubiquitin itself. The integrated nature of the UPS makes it hard to predict alternative strategies for obstructing this complex proteolytic pathway in cancer cells. Therefore, we opted for an unbiased, high-content phenotypic screen in a pursuit for small molecules that cause a general inhibition of the UPS by novel molecular mechanisms. This screen led to the discovery of the bioactivatable UPS inhibitor CBK77 that requires the redox enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), which is often upregulated in malignant cells. We show that this first-in-class compound modifies ubiquitin conjugates, causes an irreversible global inhibition of ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation, and induces caspase-dependent cell death.",
        "RESULTS": "Results\nCell-based, high-content screen for small molecule inhibitors of the UPS\nWith the aim of finding novel UPS inhibitors, we performed a phenotypic screen for small molecules that cause a general accumulation of a UPS reporter substrate (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Table S1). We used a human melanoma cell line, MelJuSo, that stably expresses the UPS reporter ubiquitinG76V-yellow fluorescent protein (Ub-YFP). Cells were treated with a diverse set of 5720 small molecules from the Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden (www.cbcs.se) for 16\u2009h at 10\u2009\u00b5M. The screen resulted in the identification of the 1,3\u2010thiazol compound CBK092352 (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig. S1A), which caused strong accumulation of the Ub-YFP substrate as well as an increase in apoptotic nuclei (Supplementary Fig. S1B,C).\nFrom the initial hit, we selected 41 analogs based on substructure and fingerprint similarity searches, as well as manual searches of the larger compound collection, to investigate a possible structure-activity relationship (SAR). This set of analogs was also further expanded through the synthesis of 19 structurally related compounds (Supplementary Fig. S2A; Supplementary Table S2). Most notably, SAR analysis showed that the 5-nitrofuran group is critical for biological activity of these compounds. Moreover, the O-ethoxy group at the 6 position (R2) improved the inhibitory effect of the compound as compared to the unsubstituted compound, whereas an O-methoxy group at the 4 position (R3) abrogated the effect (Fig. 1C). The importance of R3 was further strengthened by methyl and chlorine substitutions at this position, which also strongly reduced UPS inhibition and induction of cell death.\nWe selected a pair of closely related analogues of which one compound, CBK006377 (referred to as CBK77; N\u2010[6\u2010ethoxy\u20101,3\u2010benzothiazol\u20102\u2010yl]\u20105\u2010nitrofuran\u20102\u2010carboxamide), displayed profound UPS impairment and cellular toxicity, while the second compound, CBK085907 (referred to as CBK07; N\u2010(4\u2010methoxy\u20101,3\u2010benzothiazol\u20102\u2010yl)\u20105\u2010nitrofuran\u20102\u2010carboxamide), lacked these activities (Fig. 1D,E). The EC50 of CBK77 was determined as 4.3\u2009\u00b5M (6\u2009h treatment, 95% C.I 3.8\u20135.0\u2009\u00b5M) with no detectable inhibition for CBK07 in the tested concentration range (Fig. 1F). It should, however, be mentioned that CBK07 is not completely inert as we observed modest UPS impairment and toxicity at high concentrations (>50\u2009\u00b5M) over longer incubations (24\u2009h) (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The uptake of CBK77 and CBK07 in cells was comparable, excluding that the strongly reduced activity of CBK07 could be attributed to a loss of cell permeability (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Together these data show that CBK77 blocks degradation of a reporter substrate of the UPS and induces cell death.\nCBK77 causes global impairment of the UPS\nThe effect of CBK77 was analyzed on additional reporters that represent different classes of proteasome substrates: ubiquitin-arginine-GFP (Ub-R-GFP), a soluble N-end rule substrate; YFP-CL1, an aggregation-prone substrate and lastly, a reporter based on the T cell receptor subunit CD3\u03b4 (CD3\u03b4-YFP), which is degraded by ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Administration of CBK77, but not CBK07, resulted in accumulation of each of these substrates (Fig. 2A, B). Interestingly, the level of inhibition varied between the different classes of substrates: the N-end rule substrate accumulated to the same level as observed with proteasome inhibitor, whereas the other three substrates accumulated to intermediate levels. This suggests that CBK77 has a molecular mechanism that is distinct from proteasome inhibitors.\nWestern blot analysis showed an increase in the levels of Ub-YFP as well as the endogenous UPS substrate p53 already 2\u2009h after administration of CBK77 in contrast to CBK07 (Fig. 2C). Several high-molecular weight products were detected in both the Ub-YFP and p53 immunoblots, which gave rise to a ladder pattern that is characteristic for ubiquitin-modified proteins (Fig. 2C). Moreover, CBK77 caused a general accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates with similar kinetics as observed for polyubiquitylated Ub-YFP and p53 (Fig. 2C). Notably, the accumulation of ubiquitylated p53 suggests that UPS impairment is responsible for the accumulation of p53 and not functional stabilization as part of the apoptotic response, which is typically regulated by inhibiting ubiquitylation of p53. At the same time, a contribution of functional stabilization of p53 cannot be excluded. In line with a general inhibition of ubiquitin-dependent degradation, CBK77 treatment increased the levels of Hsp70, which is a common stress response elicited by inhibition of protein degradation (Fig. 2C). Analysis of the turnover of Ub-YFP and p53 upon inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide showed that the accumulation of these substrates was due to a delay in their clearance (Fig. 2D). Together, these data show that CBK77 inhibits proteasomal degradation resulting in accumulation of polyubiquitylated substrates.\nCBK77 causes irreversible UPS impairment followed by caspase-dependent cell death\nThe UPS is critical for cell viability and blockade of the pathway typically results in induction of apoptosis. Consistent with apoptotic cell death, administration of the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh significantly reduced cell death of CBK77-treated cells, in contrast to the compound necrostatin, which prevents necroptosis, a form of nonapoptotic cell death (Fig. 3A). It is noteworthy that the pan-caspase inhibitor did not prevent accumulation of the reporter substrate, in line with the model that induction of apoptosis is a consequence and not a cause of UPS impairment (Fig. 3B).\nInterestingly, CBK77 has an irreversible effect on the functionality of the UPS as a 2\u2009h treatment of cells with CBK77 followed by a washout and 22\u2009h incubation in the absence of the compound still caused a comparable level of UPS inhibition to that observed in cells that had been continuously incubated with CBK77 for 24\u2009h, in contrast to results for the reversible proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Fig. 3C). Accordingly, transient exposure to CBK77 was sufficient to induce cell death whereas cells were able to recover from a short incubation with bortezomib (Fig. 3D). Altogether, this shows that CBK77 induces irreversible inhibition of proteasomal degradation followed by caspase-dependent apoptosis.\nCBK77 does not cause global inhibition of proteasomal or DUB activity\nProteasome activity and DUB activity are two primary targets of compounds that have been reported to cause a general impairment of the UPS. Using an in vitro enzymatic assay, we analyzed the effect of CBK77 treatment on the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome, which is the primary catalytic site and the main target of clinically used proteasome inhibitors. In vitro analysis of the chymotrypsin-like activity in lysates of CBK77-treated cells showed that CBK77 did not inhibit this activity (Fig. 4A). Moreover, CBK77 did not impair the degradation of the ubiquitin-independent reporter ZsGreen ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (Fig. 4B, C), further excluding that CBK77 impairs UPS activity at the level of the proteasome.\nA role for inhibition of deubiquitylating (DUB) enzymes in the mode of action of CBK77 is unlikely as our analysis showed that CBK77 did not cause an overall reduction in DUB activity in cell lysates (Fig. 4D). Moreover, profiling of DUB activity with activity probes did not reveal apparent differences in the levels or activity of DUBs in lysates from cells treated with CBK77 (Fig. 4E). There was also no effect of CBK77 on the activity on USP7, USP14, and UCH-L5, three DUBs that we considered of specific interest as these have been found to be targeted by other experimental compounds (Fig. 4F). Thus, CBK77 causes a global impairment of ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation without global inhibition of proteasome or DUB activity.\nNAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is critical for the CBK77-mediated UPS impairment\nTo gain further insight in the actual mode of action of CBK77, we performed an unbiased, genome-wide CRISPR interference screen to identify mechanisms of resistance by exposing MelJuSo cells three times to the IC90 concentration of CBK77 (25\u2009\u00b5M) (Fig. 5A, B). We found a clear enrichment of guides targeting the oxidoreductase NQO1 in the CBK77-treated population (Fig. 5C, Supplementary Table S3). Moreover, the gene encoding for Nrf2 (NFE2L2), a transcriptional stimulator of NQO1, as well as the gene encoding for flavin adenine dinucleotide synthase 1 (FLAD1), which is responsible for synthesis of the NQO1 coenzyme flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), were highly enriched in the CBK77-resistant cell population (Fig. 5C, Supplementary Table S3).\nThe enrichment of these candidates suggested that the presence of NQO1 may be critical for the mode of action of CBK77. In line with this hypothesis, we found that cellular depletion of NQO1 using siRNAs reduced the accumulation of the reporter substrate Ub-YFP in response to CBK77 treatment (Fig. 5D). The catalytic activity of NQO1 was required for the inhibitory effect of CBK77 as ES936, a potent irreversible inhibitor of NQO1 activity, abrogated the CBK77-induced accumulation of Ub-YFP, p53, and Hsp70 (Fig. 5E). Moreover, administration of ES936 caused a concentration-dependent decrease in CBK77-induced UPS impairment (Fig. 5F) and improved cell survival (Fig. 5G). Inhibition of ALDH-2, which has been reported to reduce 5-nitrofurans leading to general cell toxicity, did not alleviate the effects of CBK77 (Supplementary Fig. 3A, B).\nCBK77 is an NQO1 substrate\nEven though the natural substrates of NQO1 are quinones, NQO1 can also reduce certain nitroaromatic compounds. To test if CBK77 is metabolized by NQO1, we performed an in vitro enzymatic assay that measures NAD(P)H consumption by NQO1 when reducing substrates. Strikingly, CBK77 induced the oxidation of NAD(P)H comparably to the genuine quinone substrate menadione, which suggests that CBK77 is efficiently metabolized by NQO1 (Fig. 6A, B). Accordingly, the enzymatic reaction towards CBK77 was blocked by the NQO1 inhibitor dicoumarol. On the contrary, NQO1 showed very limited enzymatic activity towards the inactive CBK07 (Fig. 6A, B).\nThe two-electron reduction of nitroaromatic compounds, which has been previously described, is expected to proceed stepwise involving the formation of three major species: the nitroso, hydroxylamine and amine derivates (Fig. 6C). Analytical HPLC-MS confirmed that the level of CBK77 (M\u2009+\u2009H+ 334) in the in vitro reaction rapidly decreased in the presence of NQO1, which was accompanied by the appearance of the 5-nitrosamine derivative (M\u2009+\u2009H+ 318) and the hydroxylamine derivative (M\u2009+\u2009H+ 320), corresponding with two- and four-electron reductions of the parental compound, respectively (Fig. 6D). Other species detected corresponded with the hydrate form of the 5-nitrosamine derivative (M\u2009+\u2009H+ 336) and the 6-ethoxy-1,3-benzothiazol-2-amine (M\u2009+\u2009H+ 195), which appears to be the product from hydrolysing the amide of the parent compound (Fig. 6D). CBK07 was poorly metabolized, giving rise to trace amounts of the 5-nitrosamine derivative (M\u2009+\u2009H+ 304) and hydroxylamine derivative (M\u2009+\u2009H+ 306) (Fig. 6E). The appearance of the CBK77 and CBK07 derivatives could be blocked by the addition of the NQO1 inhibitor dicoumarol (Fig. 6D,E). Overall, these data confirm that CBK77 is efficiently metabolized by NQO1, resulting in the production of metabolites that are in line with the anticipated stepwise two-electron reductions of the parental compound.\nCBK77 interacts with ubiquitin in an NQO1-dependent fashion\nTo identify molecular targets of CBK77, we developed an activity-based probe that allowed labelling of interacting molecules. For this purpose, we took advantage of our SAR analysis and generated the probe CBK77CLICK for activity-based target identification by introducing an alkyne group in the 6 position of the 1,3-benzothiazol group (Fig. 7A). We confirmed that the introduction of the terminal alkyne group did not affect CBK77 activity (Supplementary Fig. 4A, B). The introduced alkyne moiety allows covalent linkage of a tag-of-choice via copper(I)-catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC).\nFor identification of the CBK77 interactome, we prepared cell lysates from vehicle or CBK77CLICK-treated cells and introduced the trifunctional linker (TFL) TAMRA-azide-biotin for fluorescent visualization (TAMRA fluorophore) and biochemical enrichment (biotin group) (Fig. 7B). In-gel detection of streptavidin-bead eluates confirmed efficient enrichment of CBK77CLICK conjugates (Supplementary Fig. 4C). Mass spectrometry-based analysis identified 40 proteins to be enriched in streptavidin pull-downs of CBK77\u2009CLICK-treated samples (Fig. 7C). Upon gene ontology analysis, one of the CBK77CLICK-enriched classes consisted of proteins with oxidoreductase activity, recapitulating the involvement of a redox-related toxicity mechanism found in the CRISPR/Cas9 screen (Supplementary Table S4). NQO1 was identified but not significantly enriched, consistent with NQO1 being important for processing of the compound but not a primary target of activated CBK77. Most notably, ubiquitin (UBC) was identified as one of the most enriched proteins in the pulldown with the CBK77CLICK probe (Fig. 7C).\nIn siRNA-mediated depletion of the proteins that were enriched in the CBK77 interactome, we did not observe accumulation of Ub-YFP for any of the candidates (Supplementary Fig. 4D). Not surprisingly, the only CBK77-interacting protein that upon depletion phenocopied CBK77-induced UPS impairment was ubiquitin itself (Supplementary Fig. 4E). To validate the covalent modification of endogenous ubiquitin by CBK77, we performed ubiquitin pull-downs with tandem-repeated ubiquitin-binding entities (TUBEs). A specific smear of high-molecular weight CBK77CLICK-labelled proteins was detected that was reminiscent to the signal observed for endogenous ubiquitin conjugates, which was strongly reduced by ES936 (Fig. 7D, Supplementary Fig. 4F).\nThe labelling of ubiquitin conjugates could be due to covalent binding of CBK77 to ubiquitylated substrates or, alternatively, to ubiquitin itself. To address this question, we performed again enrichment of ubiquitin conjugates with TUBEs but treated the pulled down conjugates with the ubiquitin specific protease 2 (Usp2) to disassemble the ubiquitin chains. Treatment with Usp2 resulted in the appearance of TAMRA-labelled ubiquitin monomers, indicating that ubiquitin is modified by CBK77 (Fig. 7E). Washing of the beads after Usp2 treatment resulted in the disappearance of the ubiquitin monomers, in line with the specificity of the TUBEs for polyubiquitin chains, while some of the TAMRA-labelled smear remained bound to TUBEs. This suggest that the remaining signal is, at least in part, due to TAMRA-labelled polyubiquitylated substrates that were not deconjugated by Usp2.\nCBK77-modified ubiquitin conjugates resist deubiquitylating enzymes\nEven though CBK77 does not affect overall DUB activity, it may nevertheless inhibit deubiquitylation by rendering the ubiquitin chains less susceptible to DUB activity. K48-linked tetraubiquitin chains that had been exposed to NQO1-activated CBK77 were less efficiently disassembled by Usp2 in vitro, which could be prevented by blocking NQO1 activity with dicoumarol (Fig. 7F). An in vitro assay with K63-linked ubiquitin chains and the deubiquitylating enzyme AMSH, a metalloprotease representing a different class of deubiquitylating enzymes with a preference for K63-linked ubiquitin chains, revealed a similar inhibitory effect (Fig. 7G). Our data suggest that CBK77-modified ubiquitin chains are less susceptible to deubiquitylating activities in vitro, providing a plausible explanation for the selective inhibition of ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation by CBK77.\nCBK77 reduces growth of NQO1-proficient human cancer cells and xenograft tumors in mice\nTo further explore the importance of NQO1 for potential antitumor activity of CBK77, we took advantage of a naturally occurring NQO1 polymorphism. Individuals that express the unstable NQO1C609T variant have undetectable or trace levels of the NQO1 protein and therefore very low NQO1 activity. As expected, a breast cancer cell line derived from an individual expressing this NQO1 variant (MDA-MB-231) was largely resistant to CBK77 with an IC50 of >50\u2009\u00b5M, which was very similar to the sensitivity of the cell line to the poorly active CBK07 analogue (Fig. 8A). However, ectopic expression of stable NQO1 in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in 10-fold increased sensitivity to CBK77 (Fig. 8B). Ectopic expression of stable NQO1 in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in the accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates and an increase in Hsp70 levels, which was abrogated by ES936, showing that the proposed anticancer effect of CBK77 is dependent on NQO1 activity (Fig. 8C).\nFor an in vivo assessment of the efficacy of CBK77 against tumors, we selected the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line LS174T, which expresses functional NQO1 at a comparable level to the MelJuSo cell line used in the high-content screen (Supplementary Fig. 5A). Accordingly, LS174T cells were found to be sensitive to CBK77 (Supplementary Fig. 5B). LS174T cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of immunocompromised NMRI nu/nu mice. When the tumors had reached a minimum size of 0.1\u2009mL, mice were randomly assigned to either daily intraperitoneal administration of vehicle or 10\u2009mg/kg CBK77 (Fig. 8D). During treatment, we did not observe weight loss or obvious behavioural signs of toxicity (Suppl. Fig. 5C). Consistent with its in vitro activity, we found that CBK77 administration resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth rates (Fig. 8E) and tumor weights at necropsy (Fig. 8F). These data show that CBK77 inhibits growth of an NQO1-proficient cell line in a xenotransplant tumor model without overt signs of toxicity.",
        "DISCUSS": "Discussion\nAn attractive strategy for enhancing tumor specificity is the use of prodrugs that are activated in the altered intracellular environment of cancer cells. It has been shown that the elevated levels of NQO1 can provide a means to restrict the effect of redox-activated prodrugs primarily to cancer cells. A notable example of an NQO1-activatable antitumorigenic drug is the naturally occurring quinone Mitomycin C, which upon reduction by NQO1 behaves as a DNA alkylating agent.\nNQO1 has been linked to processes that involve the UPS. Notably, apo-NQO1 interacts and is in vitro degraded by the 20\u2009S proteasome. Moreover, NQO1 inhibits proteasomal degradation of ODC, p53, and HIF1\u03b1. The tight link between NQO1 and the UPS and its ability to interact with the proteasome may be of relevance for the inhibitory mechanism as this may position the short-lived, reactive CBK77 metabolites in close proximity to key players of the UPS, such as ubiquitin.\nOur data suggest that CBK77 targets a protein centrally involved in ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. In line with this notion, we identified ubiquitin as a protein that is covalently modified by the activity probe. Moreover, CBK77 impaired the cleavage of ubiquitin chains in vitro of DUB enzymes of different families, supporting a model in which impaired disassembly of polyubiquitin chains leads to an accumulation of UPS substrates that causes cell death. Blocking of the UPS by ubiquitin-interacting compounds is not unprecedented. Ubistatins are a group of large molecules that non-covalently interact with two ubiquitin monomers simultaneously, thereby interfering with the targeting of polyubiquitylated proteins to the proteasome. Future work focusing on the interaction between CBK77 and ubiquitin, and to what extent CBK77-modified ubiquitin conjugates contribute to UPS impairment and cell death, will be required to clarify CBK77\u2019s mechanism of action.\nAlthough CBK77 passed PAINS filters, the structural alert moiety nitrofuran raised some medicinal chemistry concerns. It should be noted, however, that the 5-nitrofuran compound Nitrofurantoin has been used for treatment of urinary tract infection with relatively mild adverse effects. Moreover, another nitrofuran-based compound, Nifurtimox, is used as a trypanocidal drug for treatment of Chagas disease. In our testing of CBK77 in a xenotransplant mouse model, we did not observe acute signs of toxicity caused by CBK77 while the tumor growth was reduced. It is noteworthy that in an earlier high-throughput screen, related nitrofuran compounds were found to activate the heat-shock response by an unknown mechanism. Our data provide an explanation for this earlier observation, as it is well established that induction of the heat-shock response can be a direct consequence of a disturbed protein homeostasis. Overall, we propose that CBK77 can provide a starting point for the development of a novel class of bioactivatable UPS inhibitors.",

Two replicates of CBK77-treated cells were performed in parallel with a common DMSO-treated sample (the number of CBK77-treated cells and DMSO-treated cells corresponded to ~200-fold and 500-fold library coverage, respectively). When less than 10% of the CBK77-treated cells were left, cells were harvested and genomic DNA was isolated using the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi kit (Qiagen), and guide and UMI sequences were amplified by PCR. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq instrument. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data were analyzed with MaGeCK and by UMI lineage dropout analysis. We considered interesting genes those which guides had an average log-fold change (LFC) higher than 1 and had a false discovery rate (FDR) lower than 0.1. A summary of the results can be found in Supplementary Table S3.\nProtein purification\nBL21 E. coli bacteria were transformed with the pGEX-6P-1 plasmid encoding GST-NQO1. Overnight cultures of individual colonies were grown at 37\u2009\u00b0C in the presence of 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml ampicillin. Bacteria were grown at 37\u2009\u00b0C in 500\u2009ml LB until reaching OD600\u2009=\u20090.6, when protein expression was induced by 1\u2009mM IPTG for 3.5\u2009h at 30\u2009\u00b0C. Bacteria were harvested and resuspended in GST lysis buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500\u2009mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1\u2009mM MgCl2, 10\u2009mM DTT) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was cleared and incubated with equilibrated glutathione sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare, 17075605) overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Beads were washed in GST lysis buffer and GST-NQO1 was eluted for 4\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C in elution buffer (50\u2009mM Tris pH 7.5, 10\u2009mM reduced glutathione, 10\u2009mM DTT). To obtain untagged NQO1, beads were washed in PreScission cleavage buffer (50\u2009mM Tris pH 7.5, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 1\u2009mM DTT) and protein was eluted by ca 40 units PreScission protease (GE Healthcare, 27084301) for 4\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C under rotation. The purity of the resulting protein was analyzed on a Coomassie gel.\nNQO1 in vitro assay\nNQO1 activity was assessed by measuring the levels of NAD(P)H via absorbance at 340\u2009nm in a Versamax plate reader (Molecular Devices; San Jose, CA, USA) at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The reaction mixture in a final volume of 200\u2009\u00b5l contained 50\u2009mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.1\u2009mg/ml BSA, 2\u2009mM EDTA, 200\u2009\u00b5M NAD(P)H as electron donor (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, N7505) and 2\u2009\u00b5g of recombinant NQO1 (for final enzyme concentration of 0.5\u2009\u00b5M). Positive and negative controls were included by adding 400\u2009\u00b5M of the NQO1 known substrate menadione (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, M5625) in the presence or absence of the NQO1 inhibitor dicoumarol at 100\u2009\u00b5M, respectively. To assess whether the compounds were substrates of NQO1, 100\u2009\u00b5M of the indicated compounds were added instead of menadione in the absence or presence of dicoumarol to measure specific NQO1 activity. Measurements were made every 10\u2009sec for 20\u2009min. For analytical high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (DAD) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), the in vitro reactions were filtered using Amicon Ultra-0.5 centrifugal filter devices with a 30\u2009kD molecular weight cutoff (Merck-Millipore) applying centrifugation for 10\u2009min at 13,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g. 100\u2009\u00b5l of flow-through samples were injected on an Agilent/HP 1200 system 6110 mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization (ESI+). Absorbance was monitored at 305\u2009\u00b1\u200990.\nProteasomal activity\nAfter treatments, cells were trypsinized and lysed (25\u2009mM HEPES pH 7.2, 50\u2009mM NaCl, 1\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM ATP, 1\u2009mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Ten micrograms protein in 100\u2009\u03bcl reaction buffer were mixed with 100\u2009\u03bcM Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC (Affiniti, P802). In one well, 500\u2009nM epoxomicin was added additionally. Samples were analyzed in a microplate reader (FLUOStar OPTIMA, BMG Labtech; Ortenberg, Germany) at 380\u2009nm/440\u2009nm every minute for 1\u2009h.\nCellular DUB activity\nAfter treatments, cells were trypsinized and lysed (25\u2009mM HEPES pH 7.2, 50\u2009mM NaCl, 1\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM ATP, 1\u2009mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100). Protein concentrations were measured with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Ten micrograms protein were mixed with 80\u2009\u03bcl reaction buffer (lysis buffer without Triton X-100) and 10\u2009\u03bcl ubiquitin-AMC (Enzo Life Sciences, BML-SE211-0025) for a final concentration of 1\u2009\u03bcM. Samples were analyzed in a microplate reader (FLUOStar OPTIMA, BMG Labtech; Ortenberg, Germany) at 355\u2009nm/460\u2009nm every 30\u2009sec for 1\u2009h.\nDUB profiling\nLabelling of DUBs with activity-based probe was carried out as previously described. In brief, after treatments, cells were lysed (50\u2009mM Tris buffer pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 5\u2009mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40). Lysates were incubated on ice for 45\u2009min and cleared by centrifugation (10,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 20\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C). Protein concentrations were measured by BCA. 100\u2009\u03bcg of protein were incubated with 4\u2009\u00b5g of HA-tagged ubiquitin glycine vinyl methylester (HA-UbVME) or HA-tagged ubiquitin bromoethylamine (HA-UbBr2) for 2\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. A DMSO-treated lysate without probe was included as a background control. After incubating, samples were denatured by the addition of LDS-sample buffer and boiled at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-HA and specific DUB antibodies.\nCLICK chemistry and analytical labelling\nCells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and the pellets lysed in lysis buffer (1% NP-40, 100\u2009mM NaCl, 50\u2009mM HEPES pH 7.2). Following centrifugation (10\u2009min, 16,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g, 4\u2009\u00b0C), supernatants were supplemented with 50\u2009\u00b5M TAMRA-azide (Jena Bioscience, CLK-FA008-1), 5\u2009mM sodium ascorbate (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, A7631), 5\u2009mM aminoguanidine-HCl (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, 396494), 0.1\u2009mM CuSO4 (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, PHR1477), and 0.5\u2009mM THPTA (Jena Bioscience, CLK-1010-25), with gentle vortexing. The reaction mixtures were incubated at RT for 30\u2009min, light protected. For gel electrophoresis, 4\u00d7 LDS-sample buffer was added. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. In-gel fluorescence was recorded using a ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad Laboratories; Hercules, CA, USA) equipped with 695/55 (Cy5, for visualization of the Precision Plus Protein Standard, Bio-Rad) and 605/50 (Cy3/TAMRA) filters and coupled to Image Lab v 5.0 analysis software (Bio-Rad).\nStreptavidin-beads pulldown using the TFL TAMRA-azide-biotin\nCells previously seeded into 10\u2009cm dishes were treated with either CBK77CLICK at 20\u2009\u00b5M or with DMSO 0.2% for 1.5\u2009h. Cells were then lysed in the aforementioned lysis buffer. Following centrifugation (16,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g, 15\u2009min, 4\u2009\u00b0C), supernatants were supplemented with 50\u2009\u00b5M trifunctional linker TAMRA-azide-PEG3-biotin (TFL, Jena Bioscience, CLK-1048-5), and click chemistry performed as described. Proteins were precipitated by the addition of a five-fold volume excess of acetone and incubated overnight at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C. Following centrifugation (16,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g, 30\u2009min, 4\u2009\u00b0C), the supernatant was discarded, and pellets washed two times with prechilled methanol. Subsequently, pellets were dissolved in 0.2% SDS in 25\u2009mM sodium bicarbonate by sonication and incubated under gentle mixing with 100\u2009\u03bcL of Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11206D) for 2\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The beads were washed three times with 25\u2009mM ammonium bicarbonate/0.2% SDS, twice with 6\u2009M urea, and three times with 25\u2009mM ammonium bicarbonate. For gel analysis, 15\u2009\u03bcL 2\u00d7 SDS loading buffer were added and the proteins released for SDS-PAGE by 10\u2009min incubation at 95\u2009\u00b0C.\nProteomics\nThe bead-bound proteins after streptavidin-beads pulldown were reduced in 1\u2009mM DTT at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009h. Next, samples were alkylated by incubation in the dark at RT in 5\u2009mM chloroacetamide for 10\u2009min. After, any remaining chloroacetamide was quenched by the addition of 5\u2009mM DTT. Digestion was carried out by the addition of 0.4\u2009\u00b5g Trypsin (sequencing grade modified, Pierce) overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Peptides were collected and dried using a speedvac. Peptides were then dissolved in 30\u2009\u00b5l 3% acetonitrile\u2009+\u20090.1% formic acid and transferred to an MS-vial.\nLC-ESI-MS/MS\nLC-MS analysis was performed using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano System coupled to a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Five microliters per sample were injected. Samples were trapped on a C18 guard desalting column (Acclaim PepMap 100, 75\u2009\u00b5m\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009cm, nanoViper, C18, 5\u2009\u00b5m, 100\u2009\u00c5), and separated on a 50\u2009cm long C18 column (Easy spray PepMap RSLC, C18, 2\u2009\u00b5m, 100\u2009\u00c5, 75\u2009\u00b5m\u2009\u00d7\u200915\u2009cm). The nano capillary solvent A was 95% water, 5% DMSO, 0.1% formic acid; and solvent B was 5% water, 5% DMSO, 95% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. At a constant flow of 0.25\u2009\u03bcl\u2009min\u22121, the curved gradient went from 6% B up to 43% B in 180\u2009min, followed by a steep increase to 100% B in 5\u2009min.\nFTMS master scans with 60,000 resolution (and mass range 300\u20131500\u2009m/z) were followed by data-dependent MS/MS (30,000 resolution) on the top 5\u2009ions using higher energy collision dissociation (HCD) at 30% normalized collision energy. Precursors were isolated with a 2\u2009m/z window. Automatic gain control (AGC) targets were 1e6 for MS1 and 1e5 for MS2. Maximum injection times were 100\u2009ms for MS1 and MS2. The entire duty cycle lasted ~2.5\u2009s. Dynamic exclusion was used with 60\u2009s duration. Precursors with unassigned charge state or charge state 1 were excluded. An underfill ratio of 1% was used.\nPeptide and protein identification\nThe MS raw files were searched using Sequest HT and validated with Percolator with Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Scientific) against human UniProt database (downloaded 2015-04-06) and filtered to a 1% FDR cutoff. We used a precursor ion mass tolerance of 15 ppm, and product ion mass tolerances of 0.02\u2009Da for HCD-FTMS. The algorithm considered tryptic peptides with maximum two missed cleavages; carbamidomethylation (C) as fixed modifications; oxidation (M) as variable modifications.\nGene ontology\nEnriched molecular functions in the proteomics dataset were calculated using String (https://string-db.org/). The minimum required interaction score was selected to high confidence (0.7) and only \u2018Experiment\u2019 and \u2018Databases\u2019 were considered. Results are displayed in Supplementary Table S4.\nMicroscopy\nWidefield fluorescent images were taken with the ImageXpress Micro XLS microscope (Molecular Devices; San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with \u00d710 or \u00d720 air objectives (NA 0.45 Nikon ELWD) and a dichroic mirror set for DAPI, FITC, Cy3, Cy5, and Texas Red. Live-cell imaging experiments for 24\u2009h were performed in Leibovitz\u2019s L-15 medium (Life Technologies, 11415-064) at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Imaging was performed using the MetaXpress software (Molecular Devices). For confocal images, the Zeiss LSM880 microscope (Zeiss; Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a \u00d763 Plan-A (1.4 NA) oil-immersion lens was used. Images were recorded using the ZEN 2012 software (Zeiss). Images were analyzed with either in-built pipelines in the MetaXpress software (Molecular Devices), custom-made pipelines in CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org) or ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). ImageJ was also used for the processing of representative images.\nIn vivo experiments\nNineteen NMRI nu/nu female mice 6\u20138 weeks of age (Taconic) were anesthetized and 10 million LS174T cells were subcutaneously injected into a flank of the mouse. When the tumors reached a minimum volume of 0.1\u2009mL, mice were randomly assigned to either vehicle (n\u2009=\u200910) or compound (n\u2009=\u20099) treatment (day 1). The mice were treated daily for a maximum of 16 days with intraperitoneal injection of either vehicle (solvent only) or compound at 10\u2009mg/kg concentration. At day 16, animals were sacrificed, and tumors weighted and cut into two parts, which were fixed in 4% formalin (for standard FFPE processing) or were frozen at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. Tumor size was assessed every two days using a caliper and tumor volumes were calculated using the formula length\u2009\u00d7\u2009width2\u2009\u00d7\u20090.44. For calculating the tumor growth slopes, tumor volumes were turned into logarithmic scale and fitted into a simple linear regression model. Animals were maintained at a maximum of six per cage and given sterile water and food ad libitum.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using RStudio, Python or GraphPad Prism version 8.3. To test for Gaussian distribution, the D\u2019Agostino & Pearson normality test was used. If the normality test was passed, data were analyzed by Student\u2019s unpaired t-test (two groups) or by ANOVA (more than two groups). If the data were not normally distributed, statistical analysis was performed using the nonparametric Mann\u2013Whitney test (two groups) or Kruskal\u2013Wallis test for multiple comparisons, with Dunnett\u2019s or Tukey\u2019s test to adjust for multiple comparisons. Grubbs\u2019 test was used for the detection of outliers. Adjusted p-values are shown. For the in vivo experiment, no blinding was performed. No sample size calculation was performed. Sample size was based on previous experiments with the LS174T cell line on testing drug effects. Data are shown as mean from at least 2\u20133 independent experiments. Error bars represent \u00b1SD (standard deviation) or SEM (standard error of the mean), as indicated in each figure legend. The following p-values were considered significant: *P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05; **P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01; ***P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001; ****P\u2009\u2264\u20090.0001.\nSynthetic procedures for chemical compounds\nGeneral methods for chemistry\nAll evaporations were carried out in vacuo with a rotary evaporator at 10\u201330\u2009mmHg. Analytical samples were dried under high vacuum (1\u20135\u2009mmHg) at RT. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on silica gel plates (Merck) with fluorescent indicator. Spots were visualized by UV light (214 and 254\u2009nm). Flash chromatography was performed using silica gel 60 (Merck). 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker DPX400 spectrometer (400\u2009MHz) using deuterated solvents. All compounds evaluated in biological tests were purified to \u226595% as determined by HPLC-MS on an Agilent/HP 1200 system 6110 mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization (ESI+).

        "TITLE": "Structure of Tau filaments in Prion protein amyloidoses",
        "ABSTRACT": "In human neurodegenerative diseases associated with the intracellular aggregation of Tau protein, the ordered cores of Tau filaments adopt distinct folds. Here, we analyze Tau filaments isolated from the brain of individuals affected by Prion-Protein cerebral amyloid angiopathy (PrP-CAA) with a nonsense mutation in the PRNP gene that leads to early termination of translation of PrP (Q160Ter or Q160X), and Gerstmann\u2013Str\u00e4ussler\u2013Scheinker (GSS) disease, with a missense mutation in the PRNP gene that leads to an amino acid substitution at residue 198 (F198S) of PrP. The clinical and neuropathologic phenotypes associated with these two mutations in PRNP are different; however, the neuropathologic analyses of these two genetic variants have consistently shown the presence of numerous neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) made of filamentous Tau aggregates in neurons. We report that Tau filaments in PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) are composed of 3-repeat and 4-repeat Tau isoforms, having a striking similarity to NFTs in Alzheimer disease (AD). In PrP-CAA (Q160X), Tau filaments are made of both paired helical filaments (PHFs) and straight filaments (SFs), while in GSS (F198S), only PHFs were found. Mass spectrometry analyses of Tau filaments extracted from PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) brains show the presence of post-translational modifications that are comparable to those seen in Tau aggregates from AD. Cryo-EM analysis reveals that the atomic models of the Tau filaments obtained from PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) are identical to those of the Tau filaments from AD, and are therefore distinct from those of Pick disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and corticobasal degeneration. Our data support the hypothesis that in the presence of extracellular amyloid deposits and regardless of the primary amino acid sequence of the amyloid protein, similar molecular mechanisms are at play in the formation of identical Tau filaments.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00401-021-02336-w.",
        "INTRO": "Introduction\nNeurodegenerative diseases with Tau pathology may present with diverse clinical symptoms and have distinct neuropathologies. In fact, in addition to differences in the involvement of anatomic areas and affected cell types, Tau aggregates may also differ in Tau isoform composition and the structure of the Tau filament. In the adult brain, alternative mRNA splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10 of the Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau (MAPT) gene yields six Tau isoforms that differ by the absence or presence of one or two acidic N-terminus inserts, and whether they contain three or four repeats (3R, 4R) of a conserved tubulin binding motif at the C-terminus. All six isoforms are found in the insoluble Tau deposits of Alzheimer disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), whereas only 3R-Tau isoforms are found within those of Pick disease (PiD) and only 4R-Tau isoforms in the deposits of other diseases such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), it has been recently determined that the fold of the core of Tau filaments in sporadic and familial AD differs from those in PiD and CBD. Furthermore, although neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in AD, CTE, and primary age-related tauopathy (PART) incorporate all six Tau isoforms, the fold of the core of Tau filaments is identical in AD and PART and different from that in CTE. Thus, the Alzheimer Tau fold may be found in the presence (AD) or in the absence (PART) of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2); however, the specific role of A\u03b2 in the pathogenesis of Tau aggregation in AD remains undetermined. In addition, whether the conformation and filament fold of Tau varies in NFTs from other neurodegenerative diseases in which the primary amyloid protein deposited is not A\u03b2 has yet to be determined.\nThe Prion-Protein Amyloidoses are dominantly inherited diseases, associated with missense, nonsense, and insertion mutations in the PRNP gene. The co-existence of parenchymal PrP amyloid (APrP) with intraneuronal Tau aggregates has been shown to occur consistently in association with some PRNP mutations; however, in Gerstmann\u2013Str\u00e4ussler\u2013Scheinker disease (GSS) associated with the P102L mutation, the neuropathologic phenotype has consistently shown present of APrP but not Tau aggregates in neurons. In Prion-Protein Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathies (PrP-CAA), which are associated with nonsense mutations in the PRNP gene, the main histologic feature is the co-existence of numerous intraneuronal Tau aggregates with APrP in the vascular compartment. Whether the co-existence of intraneuronal Tau aggregates with intraparenchymal APrP amyloid is dependent of the conformation of the APrP found in the deposits remains to be established.\nThe present work focuses on PrP-CAA with a c.478C\u2009>\u2009T mutation in PRNP that leads to a truncated PrP protein (p.Q160Ter or Q160X), and GSS with a c.593T\u2009>\u2009C mutation in PRNP that leads to an amino acid substitution in PrP (p.F198S). In these two forms of amyloidosis [referred herein as PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S)], APrP coexists with numerous Tau neurofibrillary aggregates made of 3R-\u2009and 4R-Tau isoforms, suggesting that different amyloids may share pathogenetic mechanisms leading to Tau aggregation in AD, PrP-CAA, and GSS. Importantly, the anatomical distribution of the respective amyloid protein differs significantly between PrP-CAA, GSS, and AD.\nHerein, we determined for the first time the biochemical properties and atomic structures of Tau in PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S). This work represents a significant step towards the demonstration of the existence of different conformers of Tau in neurodegenerative diseases with Tau pathology and our understanding of the role of amyloid in the pathogenic mechanism(s) of neurodegeneration.",
        "RESULTS": "Results\nTau aggregates in Prion-Protein Amyloidoses are composed of hyperphosphorylated Tau containing three- and four-repeat Tau isoforms\nOne of the hallmarks of the neuropathology of PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) is the co-existence of APrP and Tau deposits (Fig. 1, Figure S1). Severe Tau neurofibrillary pathology including NFTs and neuropil threads (NTs) in gray structures of the cerebrum and brainstem coexist in the same anatomical areas with APrP deposition. While APrP pathology is severe in the molecular and granule cell layers of the cerebellar cortex, there is no Tau deposition in any of the cerebellar compartments in either of the two diseases. In PrP-CAA (Q160X), APrP angiopathy coexists with severe limbic and neocortical Tau pathology that, as in GSS (F198S), is also characterized by the presence of numerous NFTs and NTs, that are decorated using antibodies recognizing hyperphosphorylated Tau and 3R- and 4R-Tau (Figure S1). APrP fibrillary deposits are decorated by antibodies recognizing PrP and visualized within vessel walls and intimately adherent to them, often forming rosary-like structures. APrP angiopathy involves the walls of small- and medium-sized parenchymal and leptomeningeal blood vessels. In GSS (F198S), NFTs and NTs are decorated using antibodies recognizing hyperphosphorylated Tau, 3R- and 4R-Tau (Figure S1). Tau deposits are seen in neuronal perikarya, in NTs, and in the processes that surround PrP plaques (Fig.\u00a01, Figure S1). PrP plaques may be diffuse or have cores (unicentric or multicentric plaques) that are predominantly in layers 1, 4, 5, and 6 of frontal, insular, temporal, and parietal cortices. It is noteworthy that Tau pathology is equally severe in PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S), even though the APrP pathology is localized in different compartments: i.e., blood vessels walls in PrP-CAA (Q160X) versus neuropile in GSS (F198S).\nWestern blot analysis of sarkosyl-insoluble fractions shows the presence of Tau bands with a migration pattern indistinguishable from that seen in\u00a0AD (Fig.\u00a02, Figure S2a). Western blot analysis also shows that APrP does not co-purify with Tau in our Tau preparations (Fig.\u00a02a). The purified sarkosyl-insoluble fraction enriched for Tau aggregates induces Tau aggregation in a biosensor cell system derived by transducing HEK293T cells with 2 separate lentiviral constructs encoding Tau RD P301S-CFP and Tau RD P301S-YFP. Tau isolated from the frontal cortex of PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) leads to the formation of aggregates similar to those from Tau isolated from AD brains (Fig.\u00a02b). Aggregation is not seen in samples prepared from frontal cortex (FC) from controls nor from the cerebellum (CB) of PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) patients, where PrP pathology is severe, but Tau aggregates are not detected.\nThe sarkosyl-insoluble fraction enriched in Tau aggregates from PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) was incubated in the presence or absence of pronase and evaluated by a dot-blot assay using a variety of antibodies against different epitopes of Tau protein (Figure S2a). We compared the susceptibility of the Tau preparation to pronase digestion in the two diseases to that of Tau fibrils isolated from AD, CTE, CBD, and PiD. Digestion with pronase removes the epitopes recognized by the BR133, HT7 and AT8 antibodies, located in the N-terminal portion of the molecule. It also removes the epitope recognized by the BR134 antibody, located in the C-terminus of Tau. Both N- and C-terminal portions of Tau are also referred to as the \u201cfuzzy coat\u201d. Interestingly, the epitope recognized by the BR135 antibody is partially resistant to pronase digestion, suggesting that this sequence is part of the filament core as in AD, CTE, CBD, and PiD (Figure S2b).\nAnalysis of dispersed preparations of Tau filaments by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) suggests that Tau aggregates from GSS (F198S) may be composed predominantly of paired helical filaments (PHFs) that appear to be identical to those seen in AD (Figure S2c). In PrP-CAA (Q160X), we estimate a ratio of\u2009~\u20094:1 PHFs to straight filament (SFs), while SFs could not be detected in the three different GSS (F198S) cases analyzed, suggesting that PHFs may be the predominant (if not the only) type of filaments in GSS (F198S). Using antibodies against different epitopes of Tau protein (Figure S2a) in immuno-EM, we observe that Tau filaments in PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) are composed of full-length, hyperphosphorylated Tau. Immuno-EM analysis of Tau fibrils after pronase digestion shows that the cores of Tau filaments in PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) share epitopes located in the R3 and R4 repeat domains. Treatment with pronase removes the fuzzy coat, composed of N- and C-terminal sequences, abolishing the positive labeling observed before pronase treatment. The epitope recognized by antibody BR135, which labels Tau on Western blots of dispersed filaments and in dot-blot analyses, is located in the core of Tau filaments, and is not accessible to the antibody before or after pronase treatment by immuno-EM (Figure S2c). These findings are consistent with the presence of the same Tau sequences in the core of Tau filaments in PrP-CAA (Q160X), GSS (F198S), and AD.\nCryo-EM of Tau filaments in PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S)\nWe determine the structure of Tau filaments at high resolution by cryo-EM imaging and 3D reconstruction. We observe two types of Tau filaments within the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction of PrP-CAA (Q160X), similar to PHFs and SFs of AD (Fig.\u00a03a,c). PHFs were\u2009~\u200970% and SFs were\u2009~\u200930% of the filament population, both composed of two protofilaments with C-shaped subunits (Figure S3). Two-dimensional classification readily separated PHF and SF for further processing (Fig.\u00a03d,e). We determine the structure of PHFs and SFs in PrP-CAA (Q160X) using helical reconstruction in RELION3.1 to 3.0\u00a0\u00c5 resolution (Fig.\u00a03a, c, f) (Table S1). The crossover distance for both types of filaments is approximately between 700 and 850\u00a0\u00c5 with a width of about 40\u2013300\u00a0\u00c5. In GSS (F198S), the protofilament organization of PHFs is identical to that of PrP-CAA protofilaments; however, protofilaments of SF were not visualized. Using helical reconstruction in RELION3.1, we determine a 3.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution map of the ordered core of PHFs from GSS (F198S) (Fig.\u00a03b, f), with the same crossover distance and width of PHFs from PrP-CAA (Q160X), and the same monomeric fold as the AD fold, i.e., the C-shaped unit (Figure S3).\nThe cores are composed of eight \u03b2-strands (Figure S3, S4a) adopting a C-shaped architecture that is perpendicular to the axial direction of the filament encompassing residues V306 to F378 of Tau in PrP-CAA (Q160X), and K274 to R379 of 3R Tau and S305 to R379 of 4R Tau in GSS (F198S) (Figure S3). The cores include residues located in the R3 and R4 repeat domains, with additional densities extending from the N- and C-terminal regions of the core (Figure S4a). The polar amino acids have side chains mostly facing the solvent (outside the protofilament core) and the non-polar amino acids like valine and isoleucine are facing inwards in the protofilament core forming hydrophobic patches (Fig.\u00a04). PHFs and SFs in PrP-CAA (Q160X) and PHFs in GSS (F198S) have 8 \u03b2-strands that pack together to form the fold (Figure S3i-k). The \u03b21 and \u03b22 strands run anti-parallel to \u03b28 (in a cross-\u03b2 pattern), \u03b23 runs anti-parallel to \u03b27, and \u03b24, \u03b25 and \u03b26 are arranged in a triangular fashion. In between the \u03b2-strands, glycine residues forming \u03b2-turns and proline residues breaking the \u03b2-strands reduce the stress of having 8 \u03b2-strands in one protofilament core (Fig.\u00a04). Ordered in-register H-bonding between the residues in the \u03b2-strands further reduce this stress. The residues in \u03b21 are mostly hydrophobic, packing with the last few residues of \u03b28 strand (L376 and F378). Contrary to that, the polar residues in the \u03b22 strand are facing inwards to interact with the polar residues of the \u03b28 strand (Figure S3, Fig.\u00a04). A \u03b2-turn consisting of G323 and G326 separates the \u03b22 and \u03b23 strands and provides a 90degree turn to the core. The \u03b23 strand is followed by the 332PGGG motif that forms an interface with the other protofilament forming a PHF (Figure S4b) and provides another turn in the core structure. V337 and V339 from the \u03b24 strand interact with I354 of the \u03b26 strand and L357 of \u03b27 strand to form another hydrophobic patch. The \u03b24\u2013\u03b26 strands form a \u03b2-helix-like configuration where the three strands form a triangle-like structure (Fig.\u00a04, Figure S3). The inside of the \u03b2-helix is filled with hydrophobic amino acid side chains (V339, L344, F346, V350, and I354). The side chains of the polar amino acids are facing outwards and they are mostly alternatively charged. E342\u2013K343 and K347\u2013R349 residues form the two corners of the triangle. G355 provides the turn between \u03b26 and \u03b27 strands. The \u03b27 and \u03b28 strands are interspersed by the 364PGGG motif that provides the 90 degree turn between them. PHFs and SFs differ in how the two C-shaped protofilaments interact with each other (Fig.\u00a04, Figure S4b). In PHFs, the two protofilaments are related by a 21 screw symmetry with only a small shift (~\u20092.4\u00a0\u00c5) along the filament axis, which results in the two C-shaped subunits appearing to be inverted and symmetrically interacting with each other (Fig.\u00a04). The interface between protofilaments (Figure S4b) is formed by the anti-parallel stacking of residues P332 to Q336, with the G residues 333 to 335 forming H-bondings, and two additional H-bonds between Q336 and K331 from the opposite protofilament. The protofilament surface of PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) PHFs is similar to the filament surface of PHFs in AD (Figure S4B). The two protofilaments in SF structures are asymmetrically arranged. In SFs, the sidechains of residues P312\u2013K321 of one protofilament are in close proximity with the sidechains of the residues K317\u2013S324 of the other protofilament, while the surface between the two protofilaments is not stabilized by H-bonds like in PHFs.\nAdditional densities exist around the protofilament core\nWe observe additional densities around the protofilament cores (Figs. 3, 4). As illustrated in Fig.\u00a04 by the low-pass filtered density map, both N- and C-termini of the cores have disordered densities. In the cores of PHFs in PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S), the sidechains of K317, T319 and K321 interact with an additional density outside the core. Similarly, this strong additional density is seen in the SFs of PrP-CAA (Q160X) at the protofilament interface. Fitzpatrick et al. hypothesized these additional densities to be the 7EFE9 motif at the N-terminus of the Tau protein and proposed that the formation of salt bridges stabilized the interaction between two SF protofilaments. To further investigate the extra densities seen near residues within the core of Tau PHFs and SFs, we perform mass spectrometry (MS) on Tau filaments from AD, PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S). We achieve 100% coverage of the core region of filaments from all 3 diseases. We determine Tau filaments in each disease to be highly post-translationally modified, especially in respect to phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and deamidation (Table S3). Specifically, we find peptides in which K317 is ubiquitinated in Tau filaments from all 3 diseases, which may correlate to the large extra density near this residue in both PHFs and SFs, therefore suggesting that ubiquitination of K317 may also contribute to SF stabilization. A density present near residues I371 and T373 in PHFs and SFs in AD is not present in Tau filaments from PrP-CAA (Q160X) (Fig.\u00a04) nor do we find any PTMs on these residues via MS (Table S3). In addition, a density that interacts with the H362 residue side-chain in Tau filaments in AD is seen to interact with the side-chain of K369 in Tau filaments from PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) (Fig.\u00a04). In fact, our MS results determine that K369 is acetylated in both AD and PrP-CAA (Q160X), whereas no PTMs are observed on H362, suggesting that this extra density may be interacting with K369 as opposed to H362. Interestingly, Tau in GSS (F198S) seems to be less phosphorylated at serine residues (S320, S324 and S356) located in the R3 and R4 region than in Tau filaments from AD and PrP-CAA (Q160X) (Table S3).",
        "DISCUSS": "Discussion\nPrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) are two Prion-Protein Amyloidoses that have distinct clinical and neuropathologic phenotypes. They differ significantly from Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (CJD), the most common form of prion disease. PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) are caused by mutations in the PRNP gene that lead to APrP formation and deposition in the vascular compartment in PrP-CAA (Q160X) and in the brain parenchyma in GSS (F198S). Interestingly, both conditions are neuropathologically characterized by the presence of Tau aggregates. Western blot of Tau aggregates from PrP-CAA (Q160X), GSS (F198S), and AD show identical pattern of migration and immunoreactivity using antibodies against 3R- and 4R-au, strongly suggesting that Tau aggregates in PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) are composed by 3R- and 4R-au isoforms. By TEM of negative stained preparations, Tau aggregates in PrP-CAA (Q160X) are found to be composed of PHFs and SFs, while in GSS (F198S) Tau aggregates are found to be predominantly, if not entirely, composed of PHFs. Analysis by immuno-EM coupled to pronase treatment suggests that the core of the Tau filaments in PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) contains the R3 and R4 repeats, as in AD. By cryo-EM, PHFs and SFs are found to be made of two protofilaments with a common cross-\u03b2/\u03b2-helix C-shaped architecture, as in AD. The core encompasses residues V306 to F378 of Tau in PrP-CAA (Q160X), and K274 to R379 of 3R Tau and S305 to R379 of 4R-Tau in GSS (F198S), with disordered densities sensitive to pronase degradation extending from the N- and C- termini. This is similar to the recently reported high-resolution cryo-EM structures of PHFs and SFs from AD, with R379 and E380 from the sequence after R4 at the C-terminus, and G304 and S305 from R2 in 4R Tau, and G273 and K274 from R1 in 3R-Tau at the N-terminus. Additional densities are identified near the core of Tau filaments from PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S), specifically at the sidechains of K317, T319, and K321. By mass spectrometry analysis, we establish the presence of extensive PTMs in Tau aggregates from PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S). We observe K317 to be ubiquitinated in AD, PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S), suggesting that the extra densities observed by cryo-EM near this residue in PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) correspond to ubiquitination at this lysine. We also observe PTMs that have been reported to be important in Tau fibrillization and propagation in AD, for example, phosphorylation at T231, thought to be central to the initial steps of Tau detachment from microtubules and subsequent aggregation, is found in our cases of AD, PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S). We also observe PTMs within the two hexapeptide motifs, 275VQIINK280 and 306VQIVYK310, which are known to be the minimum required motifs for Tau protein aggregation. By MS, we observe that Tau from PrP-CAA (Q160X) is phosphorylated at S199 and S202, while Tau from GSS (F198S) is phosphorylated at S202; however, Tau deposits were immunoreactive for the AT8 phosphoepitope (phosphorylation at residues S202 and T205 but also other epitopes, including S199 and S208) by immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and immuno-EM methods. PHF-1 also decorates Tau aggregates in PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) (not shown), and by MS, we are able to detect the phosphorylated residues S396 and S404, which constitute the epitope recognized by antibody PHF-1 (directed against the doubly phosphorylated epitope S396 and S404). The MS data also show deamidation of N279, which has been suggested to contribute to the AD folds as opposed to the folds seen in CBD. However, we observe deamidation at this residue only in AD and PrP-CAA (Q160X), but not in GSS (F198S) tryptic peptides, suggesting that this PTM may contribute to PHF over SF formation, and offer explanation as to the lack of SFs in GSS (F198S). In addition, we observe phosphorylation at T175 and S237 in all three diseases. It has recently been reported that singly and doubly ubiquitinated peptides at residues K311 and K317 and phosphorylation at T217 and S262 may differentiate between AD and control groups. We find that all these residues are post-translationally modified in PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S). We observe peptides containing K311 to be either ubiquitinated or acetylated, while K317 is always found ubiquitinated. Although we do not find changes in K280, PTMs in K280 and K311 have been shown to regulate Tau fibrillization in vitro. It has been previously suggested that extra densities near K317 and K321 of AD and CTE Tau may be formed by the 7EFE9 motif of Tau, which may stabilize the protofilament interface of SFs. We identify ubiquitination of K317 in PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) Tau, suggesting ubiquitin at this site as another possible explanation for the extra density seen via cryo-EM. Additional reports have suggested that ubiquitination of K311 and K317 of the core of Tau filaments would lead to SF formation, rather than PHF; however, our data show that despite ubiquitination at K311 and K317 of tryptic peptides from GSS (F198S), no SFs are found within GSS (F198S) Tau filaments. In addition, we do not find peptides phosphorylated at S320, S324 and S356 in GSS (F198S), which are located in the R3 and R4 region and are phosphorylated in AD and PrP-CAA (Q160X). Our data suggest that these specific PTMs may not be critical for SF formation, and that PTMs may not fully mediate the structural diversity seen between Tau filaments from different diseases. Phosphorylation at T175, S237, and ubiquitination at K281, have been associated with symptomatic AD at Braak VI stage \nAmyloid and Tau aggregates coexist in AD and in other diseases in addition to the group of the PrP Amyloidoses, two of which are reported here. In fact, in other hereditary cerebral amyloid diseases such as Familial British dementia (FBD) and Familial Danish dementia (FDD), a severe neurofibrillary Tau pathology occurs. Our study shows for the first time that Tau fibrils deposited in the brain of individuals with a brain amyloidosis other than AD are biochemically, antigenically, and structurally identical. Moreover, a recent study shows that Tau fibrils isolated from the brain of individuals with FBD and FDD are also structurally identical to those in AD. The co-existence of Tau aggregates with different types of amyloids suggests a common mechanism through which amyloids, whether A\u03b2 in AD, APrP in Prion diseases, ABri in FBD or ADan in FDD, trigger aggregation of Tau, resulting in Tau filaments with identical structure at their core (Fig.\u00a05). Furthermore, Tau from the brains of patients with AD, GSS (F198S), and PrP-CAA (Q160X) have similar seeding activities in vitro, as has been also seen for brain homogenates from AD and PART. For AD, it has been proposed that A\u03b2 provides a crucial element toward Tau aggregation. This hypothesis has been supported by genetic forms of AD due to mutations in the A\u03b2PP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes that consistently alter the metabolism of A\u03b2, with a consequent Tau hyperphosphorylation and formation of Tau aggregates in vitro and in vivo. Altered Tau metabolism in association with APrP has also been observed in in vitro studies and in vivo in mouse models. By determining the structure of the core of Tau filaments from diseases caused by two distinct PRNP mutations, F198S and Q160X, to be identical to the core of Tau filaments from AD, we uncover potential links between amyloid proteins and the resulting Tau aggregation. Structural data are urgently needed for the identification of specific ligands for in vivo imaging of Tau aggregates in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "METHODS": "Materials and methods\nNeuropathology\nNeuropathology was carried out as previously described. Please see Supplementary Material Methods section for detailed information regarding clinical, genetic, and neuropathologic findings. One half of the brain was fixed in formalin and the other half was frozen at \u2212 80\u00a0\u00b0C. Hemispheric coronal slabs were selected that included areas of the frontal, insular, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. These were submitted for histology and immunohistochemistry. Tissue samples were also obtained from representative brain regions. Brain sections were 8-\u03bcm thick and were counterstained with hematoxylin. Thioflavin S (Th-S) was used to demonstrate the presence of amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles. For immunohistochemical studies, primary antibodies (Table S2) were AT8 (Thermo Fisher Scientific MN1020, 1:300), Abeta (NAB 228); anti PrP (Ab 95\u2013108, 1:300); HT7 (1:1000), RD3 (Merck 05\u2013803, 1:3,000), and RD4 (Upstate, 1:100). Double immunohistochemical studies were performed using the Dako En-Vision Doublestain System (Dako) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nSanger DNA analysis\nGenomic DNA was extracted from frozen brain tissue. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for the amplification of the PRNP and A\u03b2PP genes as described. PCR products were sequenced on a CEQ 2000XL DNA analysis system (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA).\nWhole-exome sequencing (WES)\nTarget enrichment made use of the SureSelectTX human all-exon library (V6, 58 megabase pairs; Agilent) and high-throughput sequencing was carried out using a HiSeq 4,000 (sx75 base-pair paired-end configuration; Illumina). Bioinformatics analyses were performed as described.\nTau extraction\nSarkosyl-insoluble Tau was extracted from gray matter of fresh-frozen frontal cortex as previously described. Briefly, 6\u00a0g of tissues were homogenized in A68 extraction buffer consisting of 10\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.4, 0.8\u00a0M NaCl, 1\u00a0mM EGTA, 5\u00a0mM EDTA, and 10% sucrose with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After a centrifugation at 20,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g, the supernatants were brought to 1% sarkosyl and incubated at room temperature (RT) while shaking. The supernatants were spun at 100,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 1\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, and the sarkosyl-insoluble pellets were resuspended in 10\u00a0\u00b5l/g tissue 50\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.4. This resuspended pellet was further purified by 30-fold dilution in A68 extraction buffer, followed by centrifugation at 20,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The pellet, containing large contaminants, was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 1\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The final pellet was resuspended in 20\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.4, and 100\u00a0mM NaCl, and stored at 4\u00a0\u00b0C.\nWestern blotting and dot-blot\nFor Western blotting, samples were resolved on 10% Tris\u2013glycine gels (Bio-Rad) and blocked in 5% milk in TBS plus 0.1% Tween 20. For dot blots, 2\u00a0\u00b5l of diluted samples were dotted and absorbed onto 0.22\u00a0\u00b5m pore size nitrocellulose membranes (Santa Cruz), and then blocked in 5% milk in TBS plus 0.1% Tween 20. Primary antibodies were diluted in TBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 at the following dilutions: AT8 (Thermo Fisher, 1:1000), HT7 (Thermo Fisher, 1:1000), BR133, BR134 and BR135 (1:4000), RD3 and RD4 (Millipore, 1:1000), and 3F4 (Millipore, 1:1000).\nImmuno-electron microscopy (EM)\nImmunogold labeling was carried out as previously described. Briefly, a 1\u00a0\u00b5l droplet of 1:50 insoluble tau fraction diluted in PBS was pipetted onto carbon nickel TEM grids (300 mesh, Ted Pella) and blotted dry after 2\u00a0min. The grid was blocked in 0.1% gelatin in PBS for 20\u00a0min, and then, excess solution blotted off with filter paper. Primary antibody diluted 1:50 in 0.1% gelatin in PBS was added for 1\u00a0h at RT. Grids were washed three times in 0.1% gelatin in PBS for 5\u00a0min each wash. Grids were then incubated in secondary antibody diluted 1:40 in 0.1% gelatin in PBS for 1\u00a0h at RT. Secondary antibodies used were 6\u00a0nm anti-mouse immunogold particles or 10\u00a0nm anti-rabbit immunogold particles (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Secondary antibody was washed off 3 times in 0.1% gelatin in PBS and blotted dry. Negative staining was performed with NanoVan (Ted Pella) for 5\u00a0s at RT. Pronase treatment of fibrils was carried out as described. Briefly, a 5\u00a0\u00b5l solution of 0.4\u00a0mg/ml pronase was dropped onto the grid, and incubated for 5\u00a0min at RT. The pronase solution was wicked off with filter paper, and then, 0.1% gelatin solution was added to the grid for blocking. Primary and secondary antibody incubations were carried out as described above. Images were taken on a Tecnai G2 Spirit Twin scope equipped with an AMT CCD Camera.\nTau seeding assay\nTau seeds were prepared from fresh-frozen brain tissue of AD Case 2, GSS (F198S) Case 2, and PrP-CAA (Q160X) case. Tissue was thawed and homogenized in 9 volumes of buffer consisting of 10\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH7.4, 0.8\u00a0M NaCl, and 0.1% sarkosyl, with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Following a 10\u00a0min spin at 10,000\u00d7g at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, the supernatants were brought to 1% sarkosyl and incubated for 1\u00a0h at RT while shaking. The supernatants were spun at 300,000\u00d7g for 1\u00a0h, and the sarkosyl-insoluble pellets were resuspended in 0.1\u00a0ml PBS/gram tissue. The resuspended pellets were sonicated with a probe sonicator at 75\u00a0W, for a total of 25\u2009\u00d7\u2009500\u00a0ms pulses. The probe was cleaned with isopropanol and water between samples. This resuspended pellet was then centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7g for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in 20\u00a0\u03bcl/gram tissue and sonicated again as before. Following a 10\u00a0min centrifugation at 10,000\u00d7g at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, the supernatant was removed and stored at \u201380\u00a0\u00b0C until used as seeds on cells. HEK 293\u00a0T cells stably expressing the aggregation prone repeat domain of Tau with the disease associated P301S mutation, fused at the C-terminus to either CFP or YFP, were obtained from ATCC. Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% pen/strep, and 1% GlutaMax (Invitrogen). Cells were plated at a density of 50,000 cells/well in a 12-well plate, onto coverslips treated with 0.1\u00a0mg/ml poly-d-lysine for fixed cell imaging. Cells were incubated overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 5% CO2. The following day, 1\u00a0\u00b5l seed material was combined with Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher) and OptiMem medium, and incubated for 20\u00a0min at room temp. This transduction complex was then added onto the biosensor cells. Cells were incubated as before for 24\u201348\u00a0h. Cells were then washed with 1X PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and mounted onto microscope slides for imaging. Images were merged and cropped using ImageJ.\nMass spectrometry sample preparation\n8\u00a0M urea, 50\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.5 (100\u00a0\u00b5l) was added to 20\u00a0\u00b5l of insoluble Tau fractions. The sample was reduced with 5\u00a0mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) and alkylated with 10\u00a0mM chloroacetamide (CAM). The sample was diluted with 100\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl to a final urea concentration of 2\u00a0M and digested overnight with 2\u00a0\u00b5g Trypsin/Lys-C Mix Mass Spectrometry (1:100 protease:substrate ratio, Promega Corporation). Peptides were desalted on a 50\u00a0mg Sep-Pak\u00ae Vac (Waters Corporation) employing a vacuum manifold (Waters Corporation). After elution from the column in 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid (FA), peptides were dried by speed vacuum, resuspended in 40 \u00b5L of 0.1% FA, and filtered through a 0.2\u00a0\u00b5m spin filter (Millipore).\nNano-LC\u2013MS/MS analysis\nNano-LC\u2013MS/MS analyses were performed on an EASY-nLC HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). One quarter of the sample was loaded onto a reversed phase PepMapTM RSLC C18 column (2\u00a0\u03bcm, 100 \u00c5, 75\u00a0\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u00a0cm) with Easy-Spray tip at 450\u00a0nl/min. Peptides were eluted from 3 to 30% B over 85\u00a0min, 30 to 80% B over 3\u00a0min, 80 to 4% B for 4\u00a0min (Mobile phases A: 0.1% FA, water; B: 0.1% FA, 80% Acetonitrile). Mass spectrometer settings include capillary temperature of 300\u00a0\u00b0C and ion spray voltage was kept at 1.9\u00a0kV. Replicate injections were run with the same LC and source methods (CID mode and EtHCD/HCD mode). For the CID method, the mass spectrometer method was operated in positive ion with a 3\u00a0s cycle time data-dependent acquisition method with advanced peak determination and Easy-IC (internal calibrant). Precursor scans (m/z 400\u20131500) were done with an Orbitrap resolution of 120,000, RF lens% 30, maximum inject time 50\u00a0ms, 4e5 normalized AGC target, including charges of 2\u20137 for fragmentation with an intensity threshold of 5e3, and 60\u00a0s dynamic exclusion. CID MS2 scans were performed in the ion trap at rapid speed with a 1.6\u00a0m/z isolation window, 35% normalized CID collision energy, 2e3 AGC target, and 35\u00a0ms maximum IT. The same precursor scan settings were used for the DDA EtHCD/HCD decision tree method, but with a minimum intensity filter of 1e5. The decision tree consisted of either HCD assisted ETD or HCD (30%) activation of charge states, 3, 4, 5, and 6\u20138 with 2\u00a0m/z isolation window, 35\u00a0ms max IT, and 1e4 AGC target in rapid ion trap mode. The data were recorded using Thermo Fisher Scientific Xcalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. 2017). Data were analyzed using PEAKS X\u2009+\u2009Studio, including all PTMs and mutations in SPIDER search.\nNegative staining for cryo-electron microscopy\nNegative stain embedded imaging of Tau fibrils was carried out by applying 3\u00a0\u00b5l of sample on affinity materials coated lacey carbon grid and incubated for 30\u00a0min, then washed 5 times with DI water, followed by addition of 1% uranyl acetate (UA). Then, UA was washed, blotted out and the grid was dried in air for 4\u20135\u00a0min. All negatively stained images were collected on a Tecnai-12 electron microscope.\nGraphene oxide coating on Grid\nA pyrene solution was used to cover the entire TEM grid surface with a single layer of graphene oxide. This was achieved using a two-step sequence of pyrene solution coating (3\u00a0\u00b5l of 0.1\u00a0mg/ml) that was applied to the dull side of a lacey TEM grid (Ted Pella #01824) followed by 3\u00a0\u00b5l of 0.1\u00a0mg/ml graphene oxide that was applied just before the pyrene solution dried out. The grid was then incubated for 2\u00a0min before the dull side of the grid was washed three times with DI water and the shiny side was washed one time with a 3\u00a0\u00b5l droplet of DI water before drying and storing the hydrophilic grids for pyrene-mediated antibody coating.\nAffinity capture and grid freezing\nGrids for cryo-EM were prepared using the Affinity Grid technique. A multi-arm Pyrene-PEG-Antibody conjugate was synthesized. Then, a 4\u00a0\u00b5l solution of Pyrene-PEG-Antibody was applied on a GO-coated grid, incubated for 5\u00a0min, and washed three times with Tris buffer. 2.5\u00a0\u00b5l of Tau sample was applied on the antibody coated side of the grid and incubated for 30\u00a0min, and washed 5 times with Tris buffer. The final volume of liquid on the grid was adjusted to\u2009~\u20093\u00a0\u00b5l before blotting for 3\u00a0s, followed by plunge freezing into liquid ethane on a cryo-plunger 3 (Gatan) in a biosafety hood.\nHigh-resolution cryo-EM imaging\nHigh-resolution cryo-EM images were collected on an FEI Titan Krios at 300\u00a0kV with a Gatan K3- detector in super-resolution mode. The inelastically scattered electrons were removed using a Gatan quantum energy filter with 20\u00a0eV slit width. For PrP-CAA (Q160X), we recorded 55 movie frames with an exposure time of 62\u00a0ms/frame, with a dose rate of 1.067 electrons per \u00c52 per frame for a total accumulated dose of 53.35 electrons per \u00c52 at a pixel size of 1.078\u00a0\u00c5. For GSS (F198S), we recorded 50 movie frames with an exposure time of 62\u00a0ms/frame, and a dose rate of 1.067 electrons per \u00c52 per frame for a total accumulated dose of 53.35 electrons per \u00c52 at a pixel size of 1.078\u00a0\u00c5. The datasets for PrP-CAA (Q160X) Tau and GSS (F198S) Tau are composed of 2004 and 1920 micrographs, respectively, with defocus values ranging from\u2009\u2212\u20090.5 to\u2009\u2212\u20092.5\u00a0\u03bcm. Corrections of super-resolution frames were done for gain reference, binned by a factor of 2, and then, frames were motion-corrected and dose-weighted using MotionCor2. The contrast transfer function (CTF) of all aligned and non-dose-weighted micrographs were estimated using Gctf.\nHelical reconstruction\nAll subsequent image-processing was performed in RELION 3.1 software. Particles were picked manually using RELION helical picker as end-to-end segments. We extracted all the segments with a box size of 768 pixel (827\u00a0\u00c5) to cover complete crossover, down scaled to 256 pixels to speed up analysis and an inter-box distance of\u2009~\u200910% of the box length. Several rounds of reference-free 2D classifications were carried out to find homogeneous subsets and remove junk particles using a regularization value of T\u2009=\u20091\u20132. PHFs and SFs in PrP-CAA (Q160X) were visually identified from the reference 2D class averages. For PrP-CAA (Q160X) PHFs and SFs, a new 300-pixel box size without downscaling was used to re-extract with inter-box distance of approximately 15\u00a0\u00c5. A box size of 320 pixels was used for GSS (F198S). At this stage, multiple rounds of reference-free 2D classification were carried out to discard suboptimal 2D class averages. The initial 3D reference maps were reconstructed de novo from best 2D class averages of comprising a full helical crossover. The initial round of 3D classification was low-pass-filtered to 60\u00a0\u00c5. Several rounds of 3D classification were carried out to remove segments leading to suboptimal 3D class averages with regularization value T\u2009=\u200920, total classes K\u2009=\u20094. The final selected segments were used for final 3D auto-refinement with optimization of the helical twist and rise to yield 3D map showing clearly visible beta-strand separation and side-chain densities. We used a 10% helical z percentage parameter for post-reconstruction application of helical symmetry. The final reconstructions were sharpened using the standard post-processing procedures in RELION. The RELION helix toolbox was used to improve helical symmetry. Optimized twist and rise parameters for PrP-CAA (Q160X) PHFs, PrP-CAA (Q160X) SFs, and GSS (F198S) PHFs are 4.77\u00a0\u00c5 and \u2013 1.2\u00b0, 4.79\u00a0\u00c5 and \u2013 1.07\u00b0, and 4.85\u00a0\u00c5 and \u2013 1.23\u00b0, respectively. Finally, the overall resolution was calculated from Fourier shell correlations at 0.143 between two independently refined half-maps, employing phase randomization for the convolution effects correction of an optimized, soft-edged solvent mask as implemented in the trueFSC.py program of our jspr software.\nModel building\nThe previously deposited structure of PHF (PDB 5O3L) was fitted into the sharpened PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) PHF density maps using Chimera. The same was done for PrP-CAA (Q160X) SF using the deposited structure of SF (PDB 5O3T). The most central chain of each model (e.g., chain E) was adjusted into the electron density of each map by hand in Coot. Each model was then refined using Rosetta according to a previously established procedure.\nDensity map and atomic model analysis\nFor each unique type of filament, the two half-maps were separately sharpened, aligned, scaled, and matched to the same density level for comparison. If the density of a region was not present in one of the half-maps, it was considered noise and not included for final evaluation. Once noise-free density feature was determined in this process, the full dataset maps for PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) PHFs were globally sharpened with PHENIX, aligned, oriented, scaled, and matched to the density of the corresponding AD PHF map (EMD-3741) for comparison. The PrP-CAA (Q160X) SF density map was also processed and compared against the AD SF (EMD-3743) map in a similar manner. The maps were compared at the full map level, dimer level, and the monomer level.\nData availability\nCryo-EM maps have been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) under accession numbers EMD-23871 for PrP-CAA (Q160X) PHF, EMD-23890 for PrP-CAA (Q160X) SF, and EMD-23894 for GSS (F198S) PHF case 1. Refined atomic models have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under accession numbers 7MKF for PrP-CAA (Q160X) PHF, 7MKG for PrP-CAA (Q160X) SF, and 7MKH for GSS (F198S) PHF case 1.

        "TITLE": "Intercellular communication within the virus microenvironment affects the susceptibility of cells to secondary viral infections",
        "ABSTRACT": "Communication between infected cells and cells in the surrounding tissue is a determinant of viral spread. However, it remains unclear how cells in close or distant proximity to an infected cell respond to primary or secondary infections. We establish a cell-based system to characterize a virus microenvironment, distinguishing infected, neighboring, and distal cells. Cell sorting, microscopy, proteomics, and cell cycle assays allow resolving cellular features and functional consequences of proximity to infection. We show that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection primes neighboring cells for both subsequent HCMV infections and secondary infections with herpes simplex virus 1 and influenza A. Neighboring cells exhibit mitotic arrest, dampened innate immunity, and altered extracellular matrix. Conversely, distal cells are poised to slow viral spread due to enhanced antiviral responses. These findings demonstrate how infection reshapes the microenvironment through intercellular signaling to facilitate spread and how spatial proximity to an infection guides cell fate.\nCell spatial address in a virus microenvironment drives signatures in proteomes, cell cycle, and susceptibility to infection.",
        "INTRO": "INTRODUCTION\nCell-to-cell communication is the basis of multicellular life, response to environmental cues, and development of disease. The remarkable capacity of viruses to manipulate host intracellular processes is essential for establishing an infection, but less is understood about how viruses control intercellular communication and how this affects the spread of infection in tissue. Primary infection of a cell or reactivation from viral latency establishes a localized virus microenvironment (VME). In a VME, cell nonautonomous signaling pathways must be reprogrammed by either the virus or the host to promote or suppress viral spread, respectively. From the perspective of the host, intracellular sensing of pathogen-associated molecular patterns derived from the virus leads to activation of intrinsic and innate immune responses to induce the secretion of type I interferons (IFNs), other cytokines, and chemokines [reviewed in ]. Receptor-mediated recognition of these signaling molecules by uninfected cells adjacent to the infection site induces the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which restrict intrinsic viral entry and replication. Innate and adaptive immune cells, including natural killer cells, B cells, and T cells, are further recruited to clear the infection in vivo. However, in a VME, infection-adjacent cells that receive transduced messages may concomitantly undergo proviral alterations to promote virus spread.\nMechanisms by which viruses influence uninfected cells in their local environment are now coming to light. In many cases, viruses influence the VME in a manner that is unique to the pathobiology of that virus. For example, measles virus infection of the human airway causes localized proliferation of uninfected cells beneath the infectious center, which may be a mechanism to dislodge the infected cells for viral population spread. However, when comparing viruses from different families, there may be convergent proviral VME phenotypes. For example, both hepatitis B virus and enteroviruses can dampen immune responses in uninfected cells by delivering anti-inflammatory microRNA via extracellular vesicles (EVs) that shed from the infected cell. Herpes virus\u2013induced EVs have been shown to contain proteins of both viral and host origin, viral mRNA, and viral miRNA. EVs purified from human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)\u2013infected cells promote virus spread in a manner both dependent and independent of endosomal sorting. Together, it is now evident that viruses have acquired strategies to influence the microenvironment, which must be deciphered to understand viral pathogenesis.\nConventionally, the impacts of virus infection on host cells have been investigated by comparing infected to mock-infected cells collected from separate cultures or tissues. Alternatively, infected cells have been compared to the aggregate sum of those remaining from a population using enrichment methods (e.g., tagged virus strains and enrichment via the tag). However, these approaches do not distinguish more than the two populations of infected and uninfected cells from the same sample. Single-cell sequencing of tissue and cells also offers a glimpse into the interactions in heterogeneously infected populations of cells. In addition, a study developed an antibody-based protein and nucleic acid imaging method to simultaneously assess more than 30 cell markers in situ in tissues infected with simian immunodeficiency virus. However, these approaches would be enhanced by an ability to both discriminate and isolate nearby and distant cellular subpopulations. Such subpopulations may have distinct response programs based on how cells send messages through transcellular interactions and soluble mediators. An approach that would provide both spatial discrimination and isolation would facilitate a more complete spatial understanding and characterization of VME dynamics. There are also limited studies that define the functional consequences of spatial proximity to an infection. Given these paucities, it remains largely unknown not only how uninfected cells in close (neighboring) or distant (distal) proximity to an infected cell respond to a primary infection but also how cell spatial address in a VME influences susceptibility to secondary infections.\nHere, we adapted a secreted, cell-permeable fluorescent protein labeling approach paired with cell sorting to spatially discriminate and enrich for HCMV infected, neighboring, and distal cell subpopulations within a VME. HCMV is a herpesvirus that has coevolved with human hosts for more than 100 million years. Primary infection by HCMV occurs in fibroblast and epithelial cells of the skin or mucosa. Thereafter, the virus spreads and establishes life-long latent infection in myeloid lineage cells that is characterized by periodic reactivation events. HCMV is the leading cause of congenital birth defects and, in immunosuppressed adults, is linked to direct end-organ diseases and indirect posttransplantation effect. In addition, as an oncomodulatory virus, HCMV triggers pro-oncogenic pathways and favors cancer malignancy. Cell-to-cell communication is a central determinant of HCMV primary infection, latency, and reactivation as well as of the host immune response to inhibit viral spread. Within infected individuals, HCMV infection is linked to marked reorganization of nearly every aspect of the cellular landscape, including organelle spatial and contact site remodeling, metabolic reprogramming, and cell cycle manipulation to promote viral replication in G1 phase. Simultaneously, the virus has adapted to effectively suppress DNA sensing and immune signaling. These viral strategies are aimed toward promoting virus replication and spread. Moreover, the extensive reorganization of host cell organelles and membranes that occurs during infection affects intercellular communication, including secretory pathways that release membrane-enclosed EVs. Blocking EVs during HCMV infection slows the spread of the virus in tissue culture, suggesting that HCMV uses EVs to prime subsequent rounds of viral infection. Thus, HCMV infection represents a meaningful system to study cell-cell communication within a VME.\nBy adapting a system to distinguish and isolate cells based upon proximity to HCMV infection, we sought to resolve proteome signatures of the heterogeneous response to infection that drive susceptibility or resistance to subsequent rounds of viral infection. We integrated fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), quantitative mass spectrometry (MS), confocal microscopy, and cell cycle assays to establish molecular features and infection outcomes of cells within an HCMV microenvironment. In neighboring compared to distal cells, we find proviral signatures, including lower levels of IFN-inducible and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. We demonstrate that neighboring cells exhibit increased susceptibility to secondary infections with either HCMV or other nuclear-replicating viruses [herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and influenza A]. Unexpectedly, we found that the cells most proximal to HCMV infection undergo accelerated cell cycle entry with prolonged mitotic arrest\u2014a finding with implications in HCMV spread and HCMV-linked oncogenesis. Distal and mock-infected cells exhibited distinct proteome profiles, providing evidence for how a primary infection influences cell features across multiple levels of spatial proximity. Together, our study demonstrates that cellular spatial address in a VME guides cell fates by engendering susceptibility to secondary infections, with signatures in proteome composition and cell cycle progression. Our findings form the foundation for how virus infection reshapes the surrounding environment, highlighting the temporal and spatial complexities of inter- and intracellular communication within a VME.",
        "RESULTS": "RESULTS\nEstablishing a workflow for characterizing the VME\nTo design an experimental workflow that distinguishes infected, neighboring, and distal cell populations, we adapted the lipid-permeable fluorescent protein labeling strategy previously reported for studying the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, we constructed a protein that contains mCherry fused to a secretory signal peptide (SP) and a lipid-permeable peptide, TAT\u03ba, modified from the HIV-1 trans-acting activator of transcription (TAT). The resulting SP-TAT\u03ba-mCherry protein was expressed in human fibroblasts (Fig. 1A) and was not found to affect the kinetics of HCMV infection (fig. S1A). To investigate the VME, the SP-TAT\u03ba-mCherry cells were infected with an HCMV strain tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP). We selected an UL32-GFP HCMV strain, in which pUL32 is a viral protein that directly interacts with the viral capsid and for which we have previously shown to exhibit similar growth kinetics to wild-type (WT) HCMV during its 4- to 5-day replication cycle. To ensure homogenous infection of all cells, the SP-TAT\u03ba-mCherry cells were infected with UL32-GFP HCMV for 1 hour at a high multiplicity of infection [(MOI) of 5]. The infected cells were then cocultured with WT (uninfected) fibroblasts at an optimized ratio of 1:10 (fig. S1C). Given that SP leads to mCherry secretion and TAT\u03ba mediates cell entry, the infected cells were allowed to label the neighboring cells in red for 24, 48, or 72 hours (fig. S1B). The 48-hour period provided a suitable ratio of labeled and unlabeled cells to enable the further separation of neighboring and distal cells (fig. S1B). By microscopy, the ability of infected SP-TAT\u03ba-mCherry (GFP+/mCherry+) cells to label neighboring cells with mCherry (GFP\u2212/mCherry+) was evident following 48 hours of coculturing (Fig. 1B).\nIdentification of suitable coculturing and labeling conditions allowed us next to separate the infected, neighboring, and distal cell populations by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 1C). Using experimentally derived gating conditions that enriched for the three populations, more than 30,000 cells were sorted in each of the infected (GFP+/mCherry+), neighboring (GFP\u2212/mCherry+), and distal (GFP\u2212/mCherry\u2212) cell populations (fig. S1, D and E). Although at 48 hours post infection (hpi), the HCMV replication cycle in the infected cells is not yet complete, and viral particles are not yet released, thereby enabling us to investigate the surrounding neighboring and distal cells still in an uninfected state. Thus, we aimed to verify that neighboring and distal cells are not infected by HCMV. We conducted quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to quantify HCMV genomic DNA in the sorted populations. The qPCR results indicated significantly less viral DNA in neighboring and distal cells than in the infected cells, suggesting that our FACS parameters efficiently enriched for distinct VME subpopulations of cells (Fig. 1D). To further improve upon the ability to distinguish HCMV-infected and HCMV-uninfected cells within the VME, we used the knowledge that HCMV infection results in increased cell size and additionally analyzed the forward scatter profile (FSC-A) of the sorted VME populations (fig. S1, D and E). As expected, the mean FSC intensity of the sorted populations correlated with infection status (fig. S1F). Accordingly, we further refined the VME FACS parameters, increasing the gating stringency, to separate more discrete populations of infected, neighboring, and distal cells (Fig. 1, E and F; and fig. S1, G and H). Using this combination of optimized parameters, we again sorted the cellular populations within the VME at 48 hours after coculture (1:10 ratio). In parallel, we independently sorted uninfected WT cells (GFP\u2212/mCherry\u2212) as a negative control (Fig. 1G and fig. S1I).\nTo decipher cellular proteome alterations within the VME, sorted cell populations (fig. S1I) were subjected to quantitative MS analyses, through which more than 5000 host proteins and 93 HCMV proteins were detected (tables S1 and S2). While the overall protein numbers and abundances were similar across all samples (fig. S2, A to D), principal components analysis (PCA) of the proteomes indicated that the four cell populations are distinct (Fig. 1H). Further confirming that our workflow and infection conditions recapitulated known HCMV-induced protein alterations, we observed several expected changes in the abundance of host proteins (Fig. 1I and fig. S2E). Among the proteins with increased abundances in infected cells were antiviral proteins, such as interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1) and zinc finger CCCH-type antiviral protein 1 (ZC3HAV1), which may contribute to early host defenses to the infection. Also increased were translational machinery components, including eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A2 (EIF4A2), as well as the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) and eIF4F initiation complex binding partner PABPC1. This observation is consistent with the reported HCMV-induced strategy to enhance eIF4F activity and translation initiation during productive replication. The nuclear import factor karyopherin subunit alpha-2 (KPNA2) and neuron-specific enolase ENO2 were also elevated, which were reported to be important for efficient viral genome synthesis and tissue atypical metabolism through glycolysis and pyrimidine sugar production, respectively. Concurrently, we identified expected decreases in proteins including proteasome-degraded factors, such as the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN14, antiviral constituents of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, SP100, and death domain associated protein (DAXX), and the gap junction protein alpha 1 (GJA1). We also observed known decreases in E3 ubiquitin ligase components, including F-box only protein 7 (FBXO7) and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Itchy homolog (ITCH), as well as the well-recognized reduction in the receptor tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for efficient HCMV entry and virion production. In summary, we adapted and designed a workflow to discriminate and enrich for infected, neighboring, and distal cell populations to map molecular features within a VME. Host cell markers of viral infection were detected in the infected cell population, and protein abundance profiles principally distinguished each cell population from one another.\nA subset of viral proteins is detected in cells adjacent to the infection center\nIn analyzing the proteomes of the infected, neighboring, and distal cell populations, we first focused on monitoring viral proteins (Fig. 2, fig. S3, and table S1). As expected, we observed an overall abundance trend of infected > neighboring > distal for viral proteins, supporting that the enrichment of each cell population was efficient. The detected viral proteins were further categorized by their known arrangement within a virus particle (Fig. 2, A to D) and expression phase during the virus replication cycle (Fig. 2A and fig. S3, A and B). Specifically, we monitored the levels of viral capsid, envelope, tegument, and nonstructural proteins in each cell population. While capsid and envelope proteins were not represented in the neighboring or distal cells, a subset of tegument and nonstructural proteins were detected in the neighboring cells (Fig. 2, C and D). The minimal levels of capsid and envelope proteins, in conjunction with the presence of tegument proteins, suggest that these viral proteins in the neighboring cells may derive from secretion from infected cells rather than a lytic infection. This possibility was also supported when considering the temporality of viral protein expression. HCMV replication within an infected cell relies on a temporal cascade of viral gene expression, proceeding through immediate early (IE), delayed early (DE), leaky late (LL), and true late (L) stages. We found that more IE and DE proteins, rather than L proteins, were detected in the neighboring cells (fig. S3, A and B), which is consistent with a transition from early to late stages of infection after 24 to 36 hpi. To further validate our observation, we quantified HCMV proteins using a targeted, parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) MS assay that we recently developed for targeted herpesvirus protein detection (i.e., TRUSTED assay). We selected HCMV proteins known to be expressed at different stages of an infection (Fig. 2E and fig. S4A). In agreement with our data-dependent proteome analysis, while all targeted viral proteins were detected in the infected cells, only a subset was observed in neighboring cells. Most of the proteins detected were from the IE temporal class (e.g., pUL13 and pUL37). However, even within this class, some viral proteins were barely detectable (e.g., pUL122, also known as IE2). This observation matches the limited detection of capsid proteins (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the presence of these viral proteins in neighboring cells results from protein secretion rather than from the progression through an early stage of infection.\nTo directly test that the presence of viral proteins in the neighboring cells does not result from the initiation of a viral infection from virions released by the infected cells, we repeated our VME study with the addition of cidofovir (CDV) (Fig. 2F). CDV is an HCMV antiviral compound that halts viral DNA replication. As expected, in the infected cells, the CDV treatment did not substantially affect the levels of viral IE and DE proteins but substantially decreased the abundance of LL and L proteins (Fig. 2H and table S3). Despite this decrease in LL and L proteins in infected cells, the neighboring cells still showed similar IE protein levels in the presence or absence of CDV treatment (Fig. 2G). Furthermore, the decrease in L and LL proteins was even more pronounced in neighboring than infected cells upon CDV treatment (Fig. 2H). This corresponded to a sharp, CDV-dependent decrease in capsid, envelope glycoproteins, and tegument proteins in the neighboring cells that is more pronounced than in the infected population (fig. S3C). These observations suggest that the presence of viral proteins within the neighboring population of cells is due to transmission from the infected population rather than from a new or ongoing infection.\nReports have shown that viral proteins or related viral mRNA can be released extracellularly from infected cells, before the completion of a virus replication cycle. This is, at least in part, accomplished through exosomes, as it was shown upon HCMV and HSV-1 infections. Our observations of the presence of specific IE and DE proteins, and limited presence of capsid proteins, agree with such a communication between infected and neighboring cells before the release of virions. To assess whether EVs contribute to the presence of viral proteins in the neighboring population of cells, we treated HCMV-infected cells with the EV inhibitors, manumycin A and GW4869, which inhibit exosome secretion and biogenesis, respectively (Fig. 2I). Cell viability was not substantially affected by either manumycin A or GW4869 treatment (fig. S3H). At 48 hpi, we harvested supernatant from the infected cells and applied this to uninfected fibroblasts. Allowing 6 hours for EV uptake, we performed targeted MS for HCMV proteins (TRUSTED assay). Inhibition of either EV biogenesis or uptake significantly decreased the presence of all classes of viral proteins in the recipient fibroblasts (Fig. 2J and table S4). In addition, we assessed the assembly of EV-associated protein complexes, exocyst and endosomal sorting complex required for transport-I (ESCRT-I), using our previous datasets from thermal proteome profiling of protein complexes during HSV-1 and HCMV infections (fig. S3I). We found that herpesvirus infection either promoted or maintained the dynamic assembly of both the ESCRT-I and exocyst complexes, supporting the generation of EVs during herpesvirus infection. Together, it is likely that the proteomic features of the HCMV VME are the result of transmission of viral proteins and mRNA from the infected cell to neighboring cells via EVs. The presence of these viral proteins in the neighboring population may represent a mechanism acquired by the virus to promote the progression of infection.\nProteomes of infected, neighboring, and distal cells are differentially regulated\nTurning our attention to the cellular proteomes within the VME, we next analyzed the host proteomes of the infected, neighboring, distal, and mock cell populations (Fig. 3A). The host proteins were color coded in the heatmap to show their relative abundances among the different populations. K-means clustering (k = 6) was applied to the dataset to group the proteins with similar regulation patterns, and gene ontology (GO) analyses were conducted for each cluster (Fig. 3, A and B).\nAs expected, up-regulated in infected cells (cluster 1) were proteins belonging to the GO categories of viral genome replication, viral gene expression, RNA transport, and translation (Fig. 3B). Proteins involved in lipid and amino acid metabolic processes were also in this cluster, consistent with the strong metabolic rewiring effect of HCMV infection. In addition, proteins related to organelle localization and interactions were identified in this cluster, which included membrane contact site (MCS) proteins. MCS proteins are known to tether organelles in close contact (10 to 30 nm), forming dynamic networks that regulate organelle structure and biogenesis, metabolism, vesicular trafficking, apoptosis, and lipid organization. We recently reported that HCMV infection triggers a global up-regulation in MCS proteins, facilitating proviral organelle remodeling events. Having noticed that the profile of this protein cluster shows an infected > neighboring > distal/mock trend, we determined whether intercellular signals involving organelle remodeling are transmitted from the infected to the neighboring cells. Specifically, we assessed whether the levels of some MCS proteins become similarly altered in neighboring cells. Hence, we conducted a targeted MS analysis for MCS proteins using our previously developed MCS-PRM assay, which quantifies proteins involved in every major organelle-organelle association (Fig. 3C, fig. S4, and table S5). This analysis confirmed our observations from the proteome analyses, showing a trend of infected > neighboring > distal/mock for MCS proteins (Fig. 3D).\nOf interest, the subset of MCS proteins elevated in neighboring compared to distal cells suggests a proviral reorganization of organelle-organelle contacts in this uninfected population. MCSs modulated in the neighboring cells included proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\u2013mediated calcium transfer, including voltage-dependent anion channel proteins (VDACs) and inosine 5\u2032-triphosphate receptor type 3 (ITPR3), which has been shown to contribute to the metabolic profile needed for virus production. Other proviral membrane remodeling events were also suggested by changes in MCS proteins such as optic atrophy protein 1 (OPA1) and mitofusin 2 (MFN2), which regulate the mitochondrial fusion/fission balance, and acyl-CoA binding domain containing 5 (ACBD5), which aids in ER-peroxisome contacts and plasmalogen lipid synthesis. These changes were specific only to a subset of MCS proteins. For example, vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B/C (VAPB), known to be involved in ER-mitochondria tethering, was more similar in abundance to distal cells, and we previously showed that premature tethering of these organelles is antiviral through activation of stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING)-mediated immune signaling. Hence, these changes point to an overall preparation of the neighboring cells for promoting virus spread from the original site of infection.\nFurther suggesting the priming of neighboring cells, another subset of proteins that displayed an intermediate phenotype between the infected and distal/mock cells was formed of proteins related to the organization of the cytoskeleton and ECM (Fig. 4, A to C, and table S6). Similar to infected cells, the neighboring cells displayed lower levels of specific proteins with known links to the cytoskeleton and movement, collagen fibril formation, adhesion, cell-cell junctions, and receptors. These alterations may reflect the reorganization of organelle interfaces and the secretory system in a manner that resembles HCMV-infected cells. As observed for the gap junction protein GJA1, similar relative decreases were detected for the fibronectin protein FN1, focal adhesion complex adaptor protein TGFB1I1 (transforming growth factor beta 1 induced transcript 1), contactin-associated protein CNTNAP1, thrombospondin protein THBS1, and the integrin ITGA6. Previous studies have shown that HCMV infection of fibroblasts reduces extracellular type I collagen, fibronectin, and proteins involved in intercellular interactions. Specifically, focal adhesions involving TGFB1I1 and connexin junctions involving GJA1 were shown to be disrupted in infected fibroblasts. Given that reduced levels of GJA1 were also found on expression of the human papillomavirus 16 E5 protein, the dispersion of focal adhesions and cell-cell junctions may represent a strategy to promote virion spread by priming neighboring cells for an infection. Of note, the proteomic features of the neighboring cells were retained in the presence of CDV treatment (as assessed by PCA). Less than 2% of host proteins were significantly different in each VME population between the CDV treated and untreated conditions (fig. S3, D to G, and table S3). These data suggest that the molecular features of the VME derive from protein secretion from the infected cells (e.g., EVs containing viral IE and DE proteins, mRNA) rather than from the progression through an early stage of infection. Collectively, our findings suggest that HCMV infection primes neighboring cells to decrease ECM proteins, which may be a strategy to enhance viral spread to nearby cells, in part, by diminishing physical barriers to infection.\nDistal cells, rather than neighboring cells, have up-regulated immune proteins\nHaving found that neighboring cells exhibit changes that point to proviral remodeling, we had to reconcile the knowledge that infected cells are also known to activate immune signaling and drive the formation of inflammatory foci surrounding the infection site. Hence, we aimed to define the proteomic signatures of distal cells when compared to neighboring cells. The proteins in clusters 2 and 3 exhibited a pattern of distal > neighboring and were further filtered according to statistical significance (268 proteins with P < 0.05; Fig. 3A). In addition to a functional network containing proteins involved in the organization of ECM and cytoskeleton, the other major resulting functional cluster contained antiviral proteins (Fig. 4). Compared to mock and neighboring cells, the distal cells had up-regulated levels of ISGs (e.g., IFIT1, MX1, and ISG15), nucleic acid sensors (e.g., IFI16, DDX58, and IFIT5), and members of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway downstream of the IFN receptor (Fig. 4, B and C, and table S6). We validated the expression pattern of the ISGs, IFI16 and IFIT1, by Western blot analysis following FACS of the VME (Fig. 4E).\nUpon infection, there is a narrow window of opportunity for pattern recognition receptors [e.g., IFI16 and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)] to sense the pathogen and induce the expression of IFNs and cytokines. Paracrine signaling triggers the antiviral response in nearby cells, leading to the expression of ISGs. These data suggest that, despite the cells near the site of primary infection being exposed to cytokines released early during infection, it is the distant cell population that is better primed against future infection. One possibility is that viral infection can more potently induce proteomic changes in nearby cells by delivering viral RNA and proteins via EVs. In the neighboring population, we observe the presence of immunomodulatory viral proteins like pUL37 (Fig. 2), which has been shown to bind TBK1 to abrogate the TBK1-STING-IRF3 interaction and inhibit intrinsic immune signaling. Beyond cellular immunity, higher expression of proteins involved in antigen processing and presentation (human leukocyte antigens) and of the complement system suggests that the distal population of cells is primed to communicate with the innate and adaptative immune systems, a key role for fibroblasts in the early immune response to viral infection.\nCells proximal to HCMV infection exhibit mitotic arrest\nWhen investigating the proteomes of cells proximal to infection, we noted that, in comparison to distal cells, these cells exhibited an up-regulation of proteins related to cell cycle control (cluster 4; Fig. 3, A and B, and fig. S5A). This was, in part, expected, as viruses are known to exert control over the cell cycle state of a host cell to promote viral DNA replication. HCMV, a nuclear-replicating virus, encodes mechanisms to modulate the host cell cycle to gain access to host DNA replication and repair proteins while also inhibiting cellular DNA synthesis. Thus, HCMV replicates at the G1/S boundary. Infected cells within our VME had high levels of certain DNA repair proteins, like replication protein A3 (RPA3) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), and low levels of host replicase proteins, like the DNA polymerase delta catalytic subunit (POLD1) (Fig. 5A). However, the neighboring cells displayed an unexpected proteome signature for cell cycle related proteins. Compared to distal cells, neighboring cells had lower levels of cyclin D1 and Cdk6, which could indicate either arrest in G1 phase or acceleration to S phase, since these factors are known to inactivate pRb and promote S phase entry. In conjunction with the observation of higher levels of POLD1, POLA2, Ki-67, and origin recognition complex (ORC) proteins in neighboring cells, these findings point to a possible increase in S phase entry and cell cycle progression. This cell population also had significantly lower ATM levels, a proviral factor that not only is necessary for infection but that also inhibits S phase entry. Therefore, our data suggest that proximity to the infected cell promotes cell cycle progression and S phase entry. However, host S and G2 phases would inhibit HCMV replication. Hence, we expected these observations to be accompanied by additional changes in the cell cycle proteome profile of neighboring cells. We further found higher levels of cyclin B1 and aurora kinases A and B (AURKA and AURKB) in the neighboring versus distal cells, indicating increased entry into mitosis (Fig. 5A). This was coupled to the depletion of components of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) (ANAPC1 and ANAPC4) but high expression of the APC/C adaptor molecules [fizzy-related protein homolog (FZR1) and CDC20]. Together, these proteome alterations suggest that neighboring cells are coaxed to enter the cell cycle and may potentially have accelerated kinetics through the cell cycle checkpoints. In addition, inactivation of the APC/C may halt the cell cycle progression to promote accumulation of neighboring cells in mitosis.\nThese observations of changes in cellular protein abundances related to the modulation of the cell cycle are also in agreement with our above-mentioned detection of selected viral proteins in neighboring cells. Both pUL82 (pp71) and pUL97 have been reported to promote cell cycle progression and support viral genome replication. To further confirm our proteomic findings, we repeated the VME experiment, searching specifically for checkpoint proteins, proteins that mark cell cycle transitions, and protein representing mitotic processes (Fig. 5L and fig. S5, B and C). Confirming our proteomic observations, G1 arrest proteins were diminished in neighboring cells including the canonical G1/S checkpoint protein, p21 (Fig. 5L and fig. S5, B and C). Concurrently, S phase markers (proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Ki-67) and M phase progression makers (CCNB1 and AURKB) were elevated (Fig. 5L). Last, proteins associated with mitotic chromatin condensation (condensin complex subunits NCAPG and NCAPD2) and centromere formation INCENP (inner centromere protein) were elevated in neighboring cells versus both infected and distal cells (fig. S5, B and C). Together, these data suggest that cells in close physical proximity to an HCMV-infected cell accelerate through the cell cycle and may be arrested in M phase.\nTo validate the model derived from the proteome analyses, we next directly interrogated the cell cycle state of cellular populations within the HCMV VME by adapting a flow cytometry\u2013based assay (Fig. 5, B to E). The GFP and mCherry fluorescent marks used to distinguish infected, neighboring, and distal cells within the VME were supplemented with three other fluorescent channels to mark different cell cycle stages (Fig. 5, B and C). Mitotic cells were identified by Phycoerythrin-Cyanine7 (PE-Cy7)\u2013labeled phosphorylated histone H3 Ser10 (pH3-Ser10; Fig. 5, B and D). In nonmitotic cells, S phase cells were identified by a positive signal of 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, marked by a click chemistry reaction with azide-AF647. The G1 and G2 phase cells were identified by assessing 2N and 4N DNA amounts, as indicated by DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining (Fig. 5, B and E). Our findings show clear differences between each population of cells in the VME that are consistent with our proteomics findings (Fig. 5, F to K).\nBoth infected cells and the neighboring population had decreased levels of G1 phase (Fig. 5, F and H). However, the infected population displayed stunted EdU intensity compared to either the neighboring or distal cells (Fig. 5E). This observation is consistent with the viral strategy to block host DNA replication, and this EdU signal is likely from viral replication and not representative of true S phase. On the other hand, neighboring cells had a higher level of S phase compared to distal cells (Fig. 5I). Close examination revealed that the S phase profile in this neighboring population is more typical of cells in early S phase, with relatively low DAPI content and EdU signal (Fig. 5J). Conversely, the distal cells had a typical S phase profile, with most S phase cells in processive S phase with an intermediate ploidy and high levels of EdU incorporation. These findings are consistent with the observation that neighboring cells had decreased levels of cell cycle checkpoint proteins (e.g., ATM and PML) and high levels of early S phase proteins (e.g., origin licensing factors, ORC) (Fig. 5A).\nFurther examining the cell cycle profile of the VME revealed that the G2 checkpoint was not differentially activated between neighboring and distal cells (Fig. 5K). However, compared to either the infected or distal population, the neighboring cells displayed a notable increase in pH3-Ser10 levels in the 4N population, indicating elevated mitosis (Fig. 5, D and G). This observation concurred with our finding that neighboring cells had higher levels of cyclin B1, AURKA and AURKB, which promote M phase entry. Notably, the neighboring population displayed decreased levels of G1 phase cells that were proportional to the elevated levels of S and M phase cells, but the G2 population was not changed relative to the distal population. This indicates that the increase in M phase cells was not due to inactivation of the G2/M checkpoint but rather due to impaired progression through mitosis in cells proximal to infection. Visual assessment via microscopy showed that pH3-Ser10\u2013positive cells in the neighboring population of cells showed evidence of chromatin condensation indicative of mitosis (fig. S5D).\nBy expanding our cell cycle analysis to two time points following infection, we observed that there was an increase in neighboring cells undergoing mitosis from 36 to 48 hpi (Fig. 5G). This was not complemented by an increase in G1 phase cells (Fig. 5H). Together, our results demonstrate that neighboring cells exhibit accelerated kinetics through the cell cycle checkpoints and become M phase arrested.\nCells proximal to primary infection are more susceptible to secondary infections\nTogether, our characterization of the VME suggests that lines of communication between the infected and neighboring cells trigger a series of changes that may increase the susceptibility of neighboring cells to subsequent viral infections. Neighboring cells seem to exhibit alterations in intracellular organization (e.g., changes in MCS proteins), cell-to-cell communication (e.g., ECM, cell junction, and adhesion proteins), and dampened antiviral response (e.g., immune signaling and ISG proteins). In addition, the neighboring population displays an abnormal cell cycle profile. However, instead of an arrest in G1 phase, which is the cell cycle phase that supports HCMV IE gene expression and replication, we discovered an increased accumulation in M phase. This cell cycle profile may also affect the resistance of neighboring cells to secondary infections, given the known suppression of DNA sensors and transcription during mitosis.\nTo understand whether the molecular features of cells in the HCMV VME prime subsequent rounds of infection, we tested the response of these cells to secondary infections. Using a confocal microscopy-based superinfection assay within a VME context, we first tested responses to a new round of HCMV infection (Fig. 6A). The VME was established using SP-TAT\u03ba-mCherry fibroblasts infected with UL32-GFP-HCMV, which were then cocultured with WT fibroblasts at two different ratios (1:3 and 1:10; infected:WT cells) to alter the frequency of neighboring cells. Thirty-six hours later, the coculture was infected with WT HCMV (MOI of 1). Immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy was used to detect IE1-positive cells in a GFP-negative background, indicating that these cells were infected by the WT HCMV but not by the GFP-HCMV used to establish the primary infection. We next calculated the occurrence of neighboring cells (GFP\u2212 and mCherry+) and distal cells (GFP\u2212 and mCherry\u2212) that were infected with WT HCMV (IE1+). Our results showed that a higher portion of neighboring cells (i.e., cells in proximity to the primary infection) were infected on secondary challenge compared to the distal subpopulation (Fig. 6, B and C). In addition, with a secondary HCMV challenge of the CDV-treated VME, we also found higher percentage of infected cells in the neighboring population (fig. S6, A and B), demonstrating that the higher infected percentage of neighboring cells is not due to the spread of primary infection. One explanation for this higher infection rate in neighboring cells is that the neighboring cells have been primed to have increased susceptibility to subsequent rounds of HCMV infection despite being more likely to receive danger signals produced by the primary infected cell.\nGiven the ancient history of coevolution between HCMV and humans, it stands to reason that the virus may have acquired mechanisms to promote its spread in tissues via manipulation of uninfected cells. The virus encodes interleukin-10 homologs (UL111A) that are known to dampen immune responses to the virus. Our findings uncover additional means through which HCMV primes neighboring cells for infections. Given the broad tissue tropism of HCMV and its ability to reactivate during periods of immunosuppression throughout an individual\u2019s life span, the likely incidence of secondary infections with a range of human viruses is high. However, it is not clear whether the changes that are promoted by HCMV in neighboring cells are specific to only promoting secondary infections with HCMV or whether these alterations have a broader effect on secondary infections with other viruses. To answer this question, we used the secondary infection model described above to test infections with HSV-1 and IAV. These two viruses were selected to represent a similar, nuclear-replicating herpesvirus but with a shorter replication cycle of under 24 hours (HSV-1) and a nuclear-replicating RNA virus (IAV) (Fig. 6D). Our secondary infection assay revealed that cells that neighbor the initial HCMV infection are more susceptible to both HSV-1 and IAV infections (Fig. 6, E to H). Collectively, our results demonstrate that the primary virus infection reshapes the local microenvironment through intercellular communication and that the spatial address of cells within this VME guides the relative susceptibility to secondary infections.",
        "DISCUSS": "DISCUSSION\nThe spatial and temporal definitions within a VME have remained an unmet need toward understanding viral pathobiology and spread between cells. To begin to address this gap, here, we characterized the molecular hallmarks underlying how an infection influences intra- and intercellular communication surrounding infected cells based on the proximity to infection. Insight into these characteristics is essential for establishing the principles that govern the control of cell-to-cell communication, which has long-term implications for understanding the regulation of coinfections, secondary infections, virus reactivation from latency, and diseases resulting from these infections. Thus, we adapted and designed a workflow for spatially discriminating and isolating cells within a VME. From VME sites, we labeled and enriched for subpopulations of primary infected, neighboring, and distal cells. Comparisons to uninfected (i.e., mock-infected) cells enabled us to establish that infection influences cell features across several levels of spatial proximity. We found that cells that neighbor the site of primary infection contain selected viral proteins, reflecting a viral influence upon this neighboring population. We further discovered that distal cells, rather than neighboring cells, have elevated levels of antiviral and immune signaling markers. While this may initially seem counterintuitive, this observation agrees with the accumulating understanding that virus-infected cells communicate to adjacent cells via EVs to inhibit immune signaling and promote the spread of infection. These findings also highlight the power of our VME characterization to distinguish nuanced cellular features based upon spatial proximity. Last, we found that cells that neighbor the primary infection are triggered to progress through the cell cycle and arrest in mitosis, despite a preference for G1 phase for HCMV replication. In addition to proteomic and cell cycle characterizations of each VME cell subpopulation, we establish a functional consequence of cell position upon secondary virus infections. We establish enhanced susceptibility to several secondary infections with nuclear-replicating viruses in the cells neighboring the HCMV primary infection. Our findings indicate that the spatial address of a cell within an infection site guides cell fates by dictating protein expression patterns, cell cycle progression, and susceptibility to secondary infections (Fig. 7).\nThere are several tempting explanations for the observation that neighboring cells exhibit higher susceptibility to secondary virus infections than distal cells. First, from our differential proteome analyses, lower ISG levels indicate that antiviral defenses are more restricted in neighboring cells, which may be in part due to the presence of viral proteins that inhibit IFN signaling pathways. This result is consistent with previous findings that viral proteins can exist in EVs of HCMV-infected cells and viral mRNA can be present in exosomes after infection with the related herpesvirus, HSV-1. Among the viral proteins that we detected in the neighboring cells, several have reported immune-antagonistic roles (e.g., pUL37, pUL82, and pUL83) and thus could contribute to the decreases in host immune protein abundances. Second, lower levels of ECM and cell adhesion proteins suggest that ECM remodeling may occur in neighboring cells, reducing the physical barrier for the viral entry. Third, higher levels of MCS proteins were found in neighboring cells, which correlated to changes in the cytoskeleton proteins in this population. Given knowledge that ER-organelle contacts, such as with mitochondria and peroxisomes, support virus production, increased MCS proteins may serve to prime neighboring cells for the metabolic needs of infection. In addition, a summed effect of these possibilities may be occurring, which could explain otherwise unexpected signatures of each VME cell population. For example, although HCMV receptor EGFR levels in neighboring cells were higher than those in infected cells, as expected, given EGFR internalization and degradation following virion entry in infected cells, they were lower than those in distal or mock cells. In comparing neighboring to distal cells, it is thus intriguing to reconcile the lower EGFR levels with the increased susceptibility to an infection. One possible explanation is that the levels of the EGFR remaining are sufficient to sustain HCMV entry. Concurrent to lower EGFR levels, the summed effect of the altered levels of proteins involved in innate immunity, ECM, and the cell cycle may have a more significant impact on susceptibility.\nIn the neighboring population, we also observed a higher percentage of S phase and mitotic cells. This was unexpected given that HCMV infection is tied to G1 phase, although the virus also uses cellular S phase proteins. HCMV infection induces the degradation of cyclin A as a mechanism to decouple the expression of S phase proteins from the replication of the host genome. There are several possibilities to explain this phenomenon in neighboring cells. This may be a wound-healing response driven by the down-regulation of the ECM proteins. Conversely, the down-regulation of the ECM proteins could be a consequence of cells entering S phase and mitosis, which decreases anchoring. Another explanation is that most cells in tissue are terminally differentiated and in G0 phase. Viral manipulation of uninfected, neighboring cells represents an opportunity to overcome a rate-limiting step in chromatin remodeling that leads to the expression of host S phase proteins and thus hasten subsequent rounds of infection. Supporting this notion, pUL97 and pUL82 were found in neighboring cells. These viral proteins could accelerate S phase entry given their capacity to activate the E2F family of transcription factors and inactivate the pocket protein family of tumor suppressors. S phase entry is also regulated via the activity of the mitotic APC/C adaptor, Cdh1 (FZR1) [reviewed in ], which is inhibited by the HCMV kinase, pUL97, and phosphatase, pUL21a. We found that ANAPC1 and ANAPC4, both pUL21a targets, are degraded in neighboring cells, which may contribute to the mitotic arrest observed in this population.\nConceptually, mitotic cells should not support viral replication, given that cellular chromatin is condensed and the nuclear envelope can be disrupted. Mitotic entry of HCMV-infected cells decreases viral replication and induces cell death via chromosomal abnormalities. Thus, it is not clear whether the mitotic population in neighboring cells contributes to the susceptibility of this population to secondary infection. One possibility is that HCMV has acquired the capacity to induce M phase\u2013arrested cells to prepare cells for entering G1 phase. Another possibility is that the neighboring cells are arrested in mitosis before the disruption of the nuclear envelope. A final possibility is that neighboring cells undergo a prolonged mitotic arrest, followed by completion of mitosis without activation of the APC/C:Cdh1 complex. An emerging concept in oncogenic transformation is the role of APC/C:Cdh1 to maintain genomic stability by regulating DNA replication and cell division. Disruption of these proteins can lead to genomic instability and aneuploidy and are associated with cancer. In the context of HCMV-linked disease, disruption of cell cycle regulation in cells that are proximal to the site of infection may be linked to the growing recognition of HCMV as an oncomodulatory virus. Supporting this possibility is the observation of abnormalities in centrosome duplication and spindle assembly formation linked to HCMV infection\u2013induced pseudomitosis. In further agreement with this notion is evidence of binucleation in conventional viral infections at low MOIs, which may be a consequence of mitotic dysregulation or an increased rate of viral oncogene-induced genomic instability.\nIn assessing cell populations from within a VME, an important consideration was the extent to which the observed molecular signatures of infection-adjacent cells were either the result of uptake of soluble mediators expressed by infected cells or the result of an early-stage nascent infection. In support of the former possibility, our findings indicate that (i) viral capsid and envelope proteins are barely detected in neighboring cells; (ii) viral genomic DNA is barely detected by qPCR in either neighboring or distal cells; (iii) the overall proteomes of CDV-treated cells are identical within each VME cell population by PCA; (iv) CDV-treated cells exhibit the same trends in proteome changes for ECM and antiviral response proteins as well as superinfection susceptibility; and (v) treatment with EV inhibitors reduced all temporal classes of viral proteins, suggesting that EVs contribute to establishing the presence of HCMV IE and DE proteins in neighboring cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that the observed proteome changes are not being driven by nascent infection but rather by the presence of viral proteins and soluble mediators taken up by the neighboring cells.\nTogether, our study brings to light the molecular complexities governing inter- and intracellular communication within a VME. Our findings form the foundation for how a virus infection reorganizes the surrounding cellular environment in a proximity-dependent manner. The result of this intracellular signaling is the concurrent virus-directed spread of an infection and host engagement of community-level defenses. Because the labeling strategy was originally established to study the tumor microenvironment, our adapted workflow to interrogate the VME can be further applied as a multimodal framework to study other virus or infection context. This includes infection with viruses expressing other fluorescent tags (e.g., blue fluorescent protein), virus reactivation from latency, virus spread across multiple replication cycles, virus spread between different cell types, and during specific stages of infection. A relevant consideration is the labeling radius and photostability of the current SP-TAT\u03ba-mCherry labeling approach. SP-TAT\u03ba-mCherry cells were observed to label approximately five cell layers in vivo. The fluorescent protein was shown to have an intracellular half-life of 43 hours with reported retention of high fluorescence intensity due to its high photostability and ability for reuptake by cells. Upon testing coculture incubation periods of 24, 48, and 72 hours, we observed VME sites at all time points. The time point upon which we observed that mCherry labeling efficiency was optimal in providing an adequate ratio of labeled and unlabeled cells was 48 hours. Thus, future investigations could consider optimizing the approach to enable adequate labeling at earlier time points (e.g., shorter than 24 hours). This is relevant not only for understanding the microenvironment effects during early stages of an infection but also for the ability to study the VME of faster replicating viruses. We also anticipate that the proximity-dependent alterations that we observed in a two-dimensional culture system will be dynamically magnified in the complex environment of host tissue. Thus, to further investigate the VME, we envisage that this experimental platform has exciting potential to integrate with the emergence of sensitive single-cell technologies (e.g., single-cell RNA sequencing and proteomics), three-dimensional culture systems (e.g., spheroids and organoids), coculture approaches, and in vivo models. Inactivation of canonical secretory and receptor-mediated signaling pathways in a VME context will be valuable to determine their contributions to observed secondary infection susceptibilities. Given the developing knowledge of extensive heterogeneity among cells during virus infections, it will be interesting to examine the extent of heterogeneity within each VME cell subpopulation. Such investigations would enable the tracking of individual cell trajectories and fates in a VME with high spatial and temporal resolution.",

Neighboring cells were labeled through secretion of the cell-permeable SP-TAT\u03ba-mCherry by the infected cells. Proteomic profiling, cell cycle analysis, and viral susceptibility assays were performed to quantify features of the VME based on proximity to HCMV infection. Cells that neighbor HCMV infection were found to progress through the cell cycle and arrest in mitosis. Neighboring cells are primed for secondary infection by either HCMV or other nuclear replicating viruses, exhibiting increased susceptibility in comparison to distal cells.",
        "METHODS": "MATERIALS AND METHODS\nTissue culture\nMRC5 primary human fibroblasts (the American Type Culture Collection) were cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2, in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10% v/v), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml) (Gibco).\nSP-TAT\u03ba-mCherry cell line\nTo generate the SP-TAT\u03ba-mCherry construct, forward and reverse sequences of SP and TAT\u03ba were synthesized, flanked with up- and downstream restriction sites (Integrated DNA Technologies). After annealing and restriction digestion, SP-TAT\u03ba was ligated with mCherry on pLEX-MCS plasmid (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nThe SP-TAT\u03ba-mCherry MRC5 cell line was generated by lentiviral transduction. The pLEX-SP-TAT\u03ba-mCherry plasmid was cotransfected with lentiviral packaging vectors VSV-G and ps-PAX2 into human embryonic kidney 293T cells, with a ratio of 1:1:1.5. Lentiviruses were collected at 48 and 72 hours after transfection and filtered with 0.45-\u03bcm membranes. WT MRC5s were transduced with SP-TAT\u03ba-mCherry lentivirus for 2 days and selected in puromycin (2 \u03bcg/ml) for 1 week.\nSP and TAT\u03ba sequences are as follows: SP, ATGTGGTGGCGCCTGTGGTGGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGTGGCCCATGGTGTGGGCC; TAT\u03ba, TACGCCAGGAAGGCCGCCAGGCAGGCCAGGGCC.\nViral strains, infection conditions, and VME settings\nPassage 0 (P0) viruses of WT and UL32-GFP HCMV AD169 strains were generated from bacteria artificial chromosomes (BACs). Confluent roller bottles of MRC5 cells were inoculated with the P0 HCMV stocks and grown for 2 weeks until 100% of cells expressed cytopathic effect. HCMV particles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation, and viral titers were measured via median tissue culture infectious dose. BAC of WT HSV-1 17+ strain was a gift from B. Sodeik (Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany). P0 HSV-1 was generated after BAC transfection into human fibroblasts. Roller bottles of U2OS cells were inoculated with P0 HSV-1 to generate P1 HSV-1 stocks used for experimental infections. HSV-1 viral titers were assessed via plaque assay. Influenza A H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 was a gift from T. Shenk (Princeton University, USA). IAV was propagated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and was not concentrated.\nTo perform HCMV and HSV-1 infections, virus stocks were diluted in cell culture medium according to the titer and MOI and applied on the cell monolayers at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 1 hour. Cell culture plates were gently rocked with the viral inoculum every 15 min, and the viral inoculum was replaced with complete culture medium after 1 hour. The infected cells were incubated in complete culture medium until sample collection. To perform IAV infections, viral inoculum was added to Opti-MEM supplemented with N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (0.25 \u03bcg/ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 1 hour of incubation as above, cell monolayers were washed with warm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and reincubated with Opti-MEM until sample collection.\nFor setting up the VME, SP-TAT\u03ba-mCherry MRC5s were infected with UL32-GFP HCMV at an MOI of 5. The viral inoculum was removed after 1 hour of gentle rocking and incubation at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 as above. Cells were washed with PBS twice and trypsinized. WT MRC5s were trypsinized in parallel and cocultured with the infected SP-TAT\u03ba-mCherry MRC5s at a ratio of 10 to 1. The cocultured cells were trypsinized at 36 or 48 hpi for either FACS or flow cytometry experiments or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Electron Microscopy Sciences) for IF imaging.\nFor superinfection assays, the initial GFP HCMV infection and cocultures were performed as above, using two ratios of infected mCherry MRC5s: WT MRC5s (1:3 and 1:10). At 36 hours after the initial infection, the cocultured cell monolayers were superinfected with WT HCMV, HSV1, or IAV at an MOI of 1. After 12 hours, the cells were fixed for IF staining.\nFACS of infected, neighboring, distal, and mock cell populations\nFor each biological replicate, three 15-cm plates of ~90% confluent cocultured MRC5s were trypsinized and filtered with a 70-\u03bcm cell strainer for FACS. Cell sorting was conducted using a BD FACSAria Fusion flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). More than 30,000 live single cells were collected for each of the infected (GFP+/mCherry+), neighboring (GFP\u2212/mCherry+), and distal (GFP\u2212/mCherry\u2212) cell populations. For mock cell populations, WT MRC5 cells were seeded at the same time and at the same cell density as the coculture plates. Mock cells were trypsinized in parallel with the coculture plates, and more than 30,000 live single cells (GFP\u2212/mCherry\u2212) were sorted as the mock population. Cells were washed with PBS and pelleted and then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. FACS data were analyzed with FlowJo.\nqPCR of viral genome\nDNA in the infected, neighboring, and distal cell populations was extracted by phenol:chloroform treatment and ethanol precipitation. qPCR of viral DNA was conducted on ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), using gene-specific primers (Integrated DNA Technologies) and SYBR green PCR master mix (Life Technologies). Relative levels of HCMV IE1 DNA were quantified by the delta-delta Ct method using the \u03b2-2-Microglobulin (B2M) gene as an internal reference. Primer sequences are as follows: HCMV IE1, (forward) 5\u2032-TCGTTGCAATCCTCGGTCA-3\u2032 and (reverse) 5\u2032-ACAGTCAGCTGAGTCTGGGA-3\u2032; B2M, (forward) 5\u2032-TGCTGTCTCCATGTTTGATGTATCT-3\u2032 and (reverse) 5\u2032- TCTCTGCTCCCCACCTCTAAGT-3\u2032.\nNano liquid chromatography\u2013tandem MS analysis\nA total of 30,000 cells of the infected, neighboring, distal, and mock cell populations in each biological replicate were lysed in 5% SDS buffer [50 mM tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 5% SDS], reduced with 25 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), and alkylated with 50 mM chloroacetamide (CAM). Trypsinization was performed on S-Trap columns (ProtiFi) according to the kit protocol. Digested peptides were concentrated to near dryness by vacuum centrifugation and resuspended in 1% formic acid (FA). Peptides were analyzed by nano liquid chromatography coupled to tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) with a Q Exactive HF Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. One microgram of peptides (2 \u03bcl) was injected and separated with a linear gradient from 3% B to 35% B [solvent A: 0.1% FA and solvent B: 0.1% FA in 97% acetonitrile (ACN)] over 150 min at a flow rate of 250 nl/min and on an EASY-Spray PepMap Rapid Separation Liquid Chromatography (RSLC) C18 column (2 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5, 75 \u03bcm, and 50 cm) heated to 50\u00b0C. MS1 scans were acquired at a resolution of 120,000, an automated gain control (AGC) target of 3 \u00d7 106, a maximum infection time (maximum IT) of 30 ms, and a scan range of 350 to 1800 mass/charge ratio (m/z) and recorded in profile. Data-dependent MS2 scans were acquired at a resolution of 15,000, an AGC target of 1 \u00d7 105, a maximum IT of 42 ms, with a loop count of 20 (top 20 method), an isolation window of 1.2 m/z, and an normalized collision energy (NCE) of 28, and recorded as centroided. The data-dependent settings used a minimum AGC target of 4.2 \u00d7 103, no apex trigger; excluded unassigned, 1, 7, 8, and >8 charge states; and preferred peptide matches, excluded isotopes, and included a dynamic exclusion of 45.0 s.\nRaw instrument files collected from DDA were analyzed through Proteome Discoverer 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS spectra were searched using the Sequest HT algorithm against a UniProt human database containing herpesvirus sequences and common contaminants. The search required 5 parts per million (ppm) precursor mass accuracy and 0.02-Da fragment ion mass accuracy. Allowed modifications were oxidation on methionine; deamination on asparagine; phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine; acetylation on lysine; and static carbamidomethylation on cysteine. Peptide spectrum matches were assembled into peptide and protein identifications with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.01 at both the peptide and protein levels. Proteins with at least two unique peptides identified were quantified, and the peptide abundances were normalized to the total peptide amount.\nTargeted MS analysis for HCMV proteins and MCS proteins by PRM\nA total of 30,000 cells of the infected, neighboring, distal, and mock cell populations in each biological replicate were collected, and MS samples were prepared as stated above. The HCMV and MCS proteins and the peptides for quantifying these proteins of interest were selected as previously described. Peptides analyzed PRM were separated by nano LC-MS/MS with a Q Exactive HF Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the PRM method. One microgram of peptides was injected in 2 \u03bcl and separated with a linear gradient from 3 to 30% B of 60 min at a flow rate of 250 nl/min on an EASY-Spray PepMap RSLC C18 column (2 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5, 75 \u03bcm, and 50 cm) heated to 50\u00b0C. MS1 scans (used for normalization) were acquired at a resolution of 15,000, an AGC target of 3 \u00d7 106, a maximum IT of 25 ms, and a scan range of 350 to 1800 m/z and recorded in profile. Twenty PRM methods followed the MS1 scan, and were acquired at a resolution of 120,000, an AGC target of 5 \u00d7 105, a maximum IT of 200 ms, a loop count of 1, spectral multiplexing (MSX) isochronous IT turned on, and an isolation window of 1.2 m/z, and the data acquired in profile. Because this PRM panel monitored 207 peptides, the panel was split into three separate scheduled PRM methods using the above settings. Thus, 69 peptides were monitored in each method to ensure as few overlapping transitions as possible, and all peptides were fragmented with a default NCE of 27. Label-free quantification methods of the peptides were designed and analyzed on Skyline. Peak area of the top three transitions per peptide was used for quantification. Each peptide abundance value was normalized to control peptide intensities for each sample. For heatmaps, ratios were plotted of the protein abundance of each sample relative to the max abundance of the protein among all samples.\nBioinformatics and functional pathway analysis\nHost proteins were clustered by log2 abundance normalized to the mean value. Clustering was performed using Morpheus from the Broad Institute (k-means clustering with k = 6 and 1000 maximum iterations). For GO biological process analysis, gene names of the proteins from each cluster were submitted to the PANTHER classification system. Statistical overrepresentation tests were performed for each protein cluster using the GO biological process complete annotation dataset. Functional networks of protein-protein interactions were generated by Cytoscape (version 3.8.2) with the ReactomeFI Plugin.\nSmall-molecule treatments\nFor inhibiting viral genome replication, CDV was dissolved in PBS and used at 1 \u03bcM. A stock of 2 mM CDV was stored at \u221280\u00b0C. For EV inhibition, GW4869 is used at 10 \u03bcM and stored at 2 mM. Manumycin A was used at 500 nM and stored at 500 \u03bcM. Both EV inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C.\nTUNEL assay\nTUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase\u2013mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling) staining was conducted using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit TMR Red (Sigma-Aldrich). MRC5 cells in a 12-well plate were treated with 0.5% DMSO, 10 \u03bcM GW4869 + 0.5% DMSO, or 500 nM manumycin A + 0.5% DMSO for 48 hours. Cells were detached by trypsinization and fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and pelleted by centrifugation at 800 \u00d7 g for 5 min. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate in PBS for 2 min at 4\u00b0C, and washed with PBS for 5 min. Samples were then stained with 25 \u03bcl of TUNEL mix for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C in the dark. For the positive control, samples were treated with deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) before adding the TUNEL mix. For the negative control, no enzyme solution was added. Cells were then stained with DAPI (0.1 \u03bcg/ml) for 10 min and washed with PBS. Flow cytometry analyses were conducted using BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed in FlowJo to quantify TUNEL-positive cells.\nSDS-PAGE and Western blotting\nCells were lysed in 1\u00d7 Novex NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (diluted from a 4\u00d7 stock; Invitrogen) and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. Following bicinchoninic acid (BCA) measurement of protein concentration (Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 3 \u03bcg protein was loaded per lane. Proteins were separated by SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using tris-glycine gels (10%). Proteins were transferred from the SDS-PAGE gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by the wet transfer method, blocked with 5% (w/v) milk in PBS, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies. Three 10-min wash steps were performed after each antibody incubation. Protein bands were detected and quantified using a LI-COR Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR Biotechnology). Primary antibodies used were as follows: mouse anti-IFI16 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1G7), rabbit anti-IFIT1 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, D2X9Z), rabbit anti\u2013glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; 1:5000; Cell Signaling Technology, D16H11), and mouse anti\u2013\u03b1-tubulin (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich); and mouse monoclonal antibodies against HCMV proteins from T. Shenk: anti-IE1 (1B12; 1:500), anti-UL26 (7H1-5; 1:500), and anti-UL99 (10B4; 1:500). Secondary antibodies used were as follows: goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG), Alexa Fluor Plus 800 (1:10,000; Life Technologies), and goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 680 (1:10,000; Life Technologies).\nFlow cytometry\u2013based cell cycle assay\nTo mark S phase cells exhibiting DNA replication, 10 \u03bcM EdU (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added into cell culture media 1 hour before sample collection. Cocultured VME cells were trypsinized, fixed with 4% PFA, washed with wash buffer (1% fetal bovine serum in PBS), and pelleted at 800 \u00d7 g for 8 min. Cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS; washed and pelleted; and then stained with GFP-488 antibody (1:250; Thermo Fisher Scientific), azide-647 (Click Chemistry Tools), biotinylated PH3-Ser10 antibody (1:100), and streptavidin\u2013PE-Cy7 (1:100) for 1 hour each. Washing and pelleting steps were performed after each staining. Specifically, the azide-647 staining solution (2 ml in total) contained 10 \u03bcl of 2 mM azide-647, 40 \u03bcl of 100 mM CuSO4, 40 \u03bcl of 500 mM sodium ascorbate, and 1910 \u03bcl of PBS. DAPI was stained at last (1:1000) for 10 min. Single-color control samples were collected and stained for setting up the gating and compensation. Flow cytometry analyses were conducted using BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed in FlowJo.\nIF microscopy and IF quantification\nIF microscopy was conducted using a Nikon A1R confocal microscope. Image processing and IF quantification were conducted on Fiji. For IF quantification, cell nuclei were stained with DAPI, and a viral marker was stained with the mouse IE1 primary antibody (clone 1B12; gift from T. Shenk) for HCMV infection, the ICP4 antibody (ab6514, Abcam) for HSV-1 infection, or the nucleoprotein (NP) antibody (gift from T. Shenk) for IAV infection. Alexa Fluor 633 rabbit anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody. Biological replicates represented different coculture wells, and one merged microscopic field was acquired for each well. Five-by-five merged images were taken using 20\u00d7 objective lens, and three z-stacks were acquired with a 3-\u03bcm step size. Eight-bit binning and max projection were applied to the images, and a median filter with 5-\u03bcm pixel was set to remove speckles. Using the analyze particle function, the ratio of viral marker\u2013positive particle number to DAPI-positive particle number is calculated as the proportion of superinfected cells in neighboring (GFP\u2212/mCherry+) and distal (GFP\u2212/mCherry\u2212) populations. For each biological replicate, a minimum of 2000 cells were quantified (~3000 cells on average with a range of 2027 to 3799 cells). Approximately 160 primary infection events with 1:10 coculture ratio (range of 122 to 212 events) and ~500 primary infection events with a 1:3 coculture ratio (range of 335 to 676 events) were quantified . In the HCMV superinfection assay, we first determined the ratio (r) of IE1+ cells to VME primary infection events, representing IE1+ neighboring cells from the primary HCMV infection. Independently, we next superinfected an HCMV VME monolayer with an additional round of HCMV infection, exclusively quantifying neighboring cells that exhibited secondary HCMV infection by: [(IE1+) \u2013 r*(GFP+)]/[(DAPI+) \u2013 r*(GFP+)].\nQuantification and statistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism. Significance was determined by two-tailed Student\u2019s t test (n = 3 biological replicates) unless otherwise stated. Where applicable: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.",

        "TITLE": "RecA-dependent or independent recombination of plasmid DNA generates a conflict with the host EcoKI immunity by launching restriction alleviation",
        "ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nBacterial defence systems are tightly regulated to avoid autoimmunity. In Type I restriction\u2013modification (R\u2013M) systems, a specific mechanism called restriction alleviation (RA) controls the activity of the restriction module. In the case of the Escherichia coli Type I R\u2013M system EcoKI, RA proceeds through ClpXP-mediated proteolysis of restriction complexes bound to non-methylated sites that appear after replication or reparation of host DNA. Here, we show that RA is also induced in the presence of plasmids carrying EcoKI recognition sites, a phenomenon we refer to as plasmid-induced RA. Further, we show that the anti-restriction behavior of plasmid-borne non-conjugative transposons such as Tn5053, previously attributed to their ardD loci, is due to plasmid-induced RA. Plasmids carrying both EcoKI and Chi sites induce RA in RecA- and RecBCD-dependent manner. However, inactivation of both RecA and RecBCD restores RA, indicating that there exists an alternative, RecA-independent, homologous recombination pathway that is blocked in the presence of RecBCD. Indeed, plasmid-induced RA in a RecBCD-deficient background does not depend on the presence of Chi sites. We propose that processing of random dsDNA breaks in plasmid DNA via homologous recombination generates non-methylated EcoKI sites, which attract EcoKI restriction complexes channeling them for ClpXP-mediated proteolysis.\nGraphical Abstract",
        "INTRO": "Introduction\nBacteria and phages are locked in a constant arms race that generates an enormous variety of defensive and offensive strategies. The anti-phage arsenal of bacteria should be \u2018balanced\u2019 to avoid autoimmunity. To lower the negative costs, defence genes are tightly regulated, and are often induced only at conditions of higher cell density, which favor phage propagation. In addition, \u2018inherent brake\u2019 mechanisms such as ring nucleases in Type III CRISPR-Cas or Trip13-like ATPases in Type III CBASS systems prevent false activation of defence systems by repressing secondary messenger signaling. In the absence of phage pressure, defence genes can be lost to decrease fitness costs associated with their toxicity. As a consequence, anti-phage immunity systems represent the major source of variability between closely related bacterial strains.\nDefensive activity of some Type I restriction\u2013modification (R\u2013M) systems is controlled through a restriction alleviation (RA) mechanism. Type I R\u2013M systems encode three subunits: HsdM (methyltransferase), HsdS (site recognition)\u00a0and HsdR (endonuclease and ATPase that powers DNA translocation). The restriction enzyme is a heteropentameric M2S1R2 complex that also possesses the methylation activity; the M2S1 complex is capable of methylation only. The prototypical Type I system EcoKI recognizes asymmetric bipartite DNA sites AACNNNNNNGTGC, which are methylated at adenines in both DNA strands at the underlined positions. Upon recognition of a non-methylated site, HsdR subunits start translocating DNA, which is looped through the DNA-bound restriction complex, resulting in \u2018rabbit ear\u2019 structures. The DNA cleavage reaction occurs when translocation initiated by two neighboring complexes results in HsdR subunits collision, upon which each nuclease introduces a nick, jointly producing a double-stranded DNA break. Other obstacles that interfere with DNA translocation, such as replication forks, can also activate the DNA cleavage reaction. Hemi-methylated sites that appear after replication are recognized by methylation complexes which add the missing methyl group. However, replication fork stalling followed by recombinational repair between two newly synthesized non-methylated DNA strands could result in the appearance of non-methylated sites that will be subject to restriction and thus damaging to the host.\nRA is one of the signature phenotypes observed upon UV irradiation of Escherichia coli. Depending on the irradiation dose, E. coli cells harboring EcoKI temporarily lose, partially or completely, protection against phage \u03bb infection. A similar behavior is observed when cells are exposed to 2-aminopurine (2-AP), a chemical agent that is incorporated in DNA instead of adenine but is not subject to methylation. Based on these observations, it was suggested that RA allows cells to avoid cleavage of non-methylated EcoKI sites in host DNA that appear after replication/reparation and accumulate upon DNA damage. Later studies identified that RA is mediated by the ClpXP protease, which degrades the HsdR endonuclease. In vivo and in vitro assays showed that HsdR becomes available for proteolysis during the translocation stage.\nClearly, RA should not be activated during phage infection. While the exact mechanism is unknown, it can be speculated that the time of translocation along viral DNA is shorter than that on host DNA. All EcoKI sites in incoming phage DNA are non-methylated and thus the time from non-methylated EcoKI site recognition to collision with another complex bound to non-methylated site is short. In contrast, generation of non-methylated sites in EcoKI+ host DNA is a random and likely not efficient process, possibly requiring DNA damage events. Thus, the restriction enzyme would spend a much longer time in a proteolysis-prone translocation state before it encounters another complex bound to a different non-methylated EcoKI site. It was also proposed that the difference in the condensation state between the phage and the host DNA might play a role. The ClpXP-dependent RA was shown for EcoKI and EcoA systems. In the case of EcoR124I it was proposed that RA-like behavior is mediated by the stability of the restriction complex, since HsdR (A957V) mutation increasing the rate of translocation initiation events was shown to produce an RA-deficient phenotype. Whether other modification-dependent immunity systems rely on proteolytic control of their activity remains to be determined.\nPhages and mobile genetic elements developed multiple strategies to cope with R\u2013M systems, from avoidance of recognition sites to extensive modification of their DNA and expression of anti-restriction proteins. Examples of the latter strategy include a T7 phage DNA mimic protein Ocr, which competes with DNA for interaction with Type I restriction complexes, and T3 phage S-adenosylmethionine-lyase, which depletes SAM, an essential co-factor for Type I restriction. The P1 phage injects capsid-loaded DarA and DarB proteins that inactivate different Type I R\u2013M systems through a mechanism that has not been defined. Many conjugative plasmids and other mobile elements encode anti-restriction Ard (Alleviation of restriction of DNA) proteins. ArdA is a DNA mimic; ArdB inhibits Type I R\u2013M in vivo through an unknown mechanism; ArdC contains an ssDNA binding domain and may protect single-stranded DNA entering cells during conjugation. Plasmids carrying some non-conjugative transposons, e.g. Tn5053, also suppress the EcoKI defence. A putative gene ardD encoded in the anti-sense strand of the transposase gene tniA was proposed to be responsible for this phenotype. In contrast to other Ard mechanisms, the ardD anti-restriction was dependent on ClpXP, suggesting that Tn5053 can manipulate EcoKI activity through an RA-like mechanism.\nHere, we report that ClpXP-dependent RA of the EcoKI system is activated by the presence of plasmids carrying EcoKI and Chi sites. The same plasmid-induced RA mechanism is operational in cells carrying plasmids with cloned non-conjugative transposons. We therefore submit that the putative ardD transposon gene that was proposed to be responsible for RA is likely non-existent. The simultaneous presence of plasmid-borne EcoKI and Chi sites in EcoKI+ cells promotes RA through RecBCD-dependent recombination. In cells lacking both RecA and RecBCD, plasmid-induced RA that no longer depends on the presence of Chi sites is observed, suggesting the existence of an alternative, RecA-independent recombination pathway that becomes activated when dsDNA ends are not occupied by RecBCD.",
        "RESULTS": "Results\nPlasmids containing fragments of P1 phage dar locus inhibit the EcoKI defence\nBacteriophage P1 Dar proteins inhibit Type I R\u2013M defences of the E. coli host and deletion of the darB gene encoding a 2255-amino acid long protein with predicted methyltransferase and helicase domains renders the phage sensitive to EcoB and EcoK defences. To check whether the dar genes products are sufficient for Type I R\u2013M inhibition, we cloned darB, as well as other dar genes and their combinations in the pBAD vector and transformed the resulting plasmids into E. coli AB1157 EcoKI+ strain. A plasmid expressing T7 Ocr, a strong inhibitor of EcoKI, was used as a control. Among various plasmids tested, only pBAD_darB and pBAD_darB_ulx made AB1157 sensitive to phage \u03bb infection (Figures 1A, S1). Curiously, inactivation of the EcoK1 defence was not dependent on the presence of arabinose, an inducer of cloned genes expression (Supplementary Figure S2). Moreover, plasmids carrying darB variants encoding proteins with mutated predicted catalytic residues also made AB1157 sensitive to \u03bb infection (data not shown). To investigate whether the anti-restriction effect is associated with the DarB protein, we introduced a premature stop codon into the full-sized plasmid-borne darB or into its truncated version encoding the first 350 DarB amino acids (this plasmid is hereafter referred to as pRA). Both plasmids inhibited the EcoKI defence as efficiently as the corresponding plasmids without the introduced stop codons (Figure 1B). The results thus suggest that neither the protein product of the darB gene nor its transcription are required for inhibition of the EcoKI defence. In other words, a fragment of darB gene sequence or its combination with the pBAD plasmid inhibits EcoKI.\nChi and EcoKI sites in plasmid DNA are required to activate RA in the wild-type host background\nThe P1 genome is enriched with Chi sites; the full-sized darB gene carries 11 Chi sites; the darB fragment in the pRA plasmid has one. Other dar genes, which do not cause anti-restriction when present on the pBAD vector, have none. Chi sites are also not present in the pBAD sequence. The asymmetric Chi sequence (5\u2032GCTGGTGG) is recognized by the RecBCD nuclease-helicase complex, which processes double-stranded DNA breaks. Chi sequence recognition by the RecC subunit activates the loading of RecA onto ssDNA generated by RecBCD, which promotes homologous recombination. We hypothesized that Chi-mediated plasmid recombination may be the reason for the anti-restriction activity of plasmids carrying darB or its fragment. Indeed, when we mutated the only Chi site present in pRA, the anti-restriction activity was lost. In contrast, reversing the orientation of Chi had no effect (Figure 1C).\nThe pBAD vector carries a single EcoKI recognition site in its ampicillin resistance gene bla. To investigate whether this EcoKI site is required for anti-restriction activity, we introduced mutations that destroyed the site without affecting the sequence of the beta-lactamase protein. Cells carrying the resulting pRA derivative were resistant to \u03bb infection (Figure 1C). Thus, the simultaneous presence of Chi and EcoKI sites is required for plasmid-induced anti-restriction activity against EcoKI. Since the observed phenomenon is reminiscent of restriction alleviation activated by the presence of non-methylated EcoKI sites in host DNA, we tested whether plasmid-mediated anti-restriction is dependent on the ClpXP protease responsible for the HsdR subunit degradation. Anti-restriction by either pBAD_darB or pRA was lost in the \u0394clpX background (Figure 1D), confirming that plasmid DNA serves as a novel input inducing ClpXP-mediated RA.\nTn5053 anti-restriction does not depend on the ardD locus but is caused by plasmid-induced RA\nNon-conjugative transposon Tn5053 cloned on a high-copy number pUC18 vector provides a strong anti-restriction effect in the AB1157 strain infected with \u03bb phage. The pUC-Tn5053 induced RA is ClpXP-dependent and was linked to ardD, a putative protein-coding gene located within and transcribed from a different strand of the tniA transposase gene. The ardD gene expression has never been demonstrated and we did not observe any anti-restriction activity of ardD cloned into pBAD expression vector (Supplementary Figure S3A). We hypothesized that similarly to darB plasmids (above), anti-restriction associated with Tn5053 is explained by plasmid-induced RA. We introduced a premature stop-codon into the predicted ardD ORF without affecting the\u00a0sequence of the TniA transposase and tested the resulting derivative of pUC-Tn5053 for anti-restriction. As can be seen from Figure 2A, EcoKI defence was not restored upon inactivation of the predicted ardD ORF. We next completely removed the ardD locus from pUC-Tn5053. This disrupted the tniA gene but had no effect on pUC-Tn5053-mediated anti-restriction (Figure 2A). We conclude, that neither ardD (if it exists) nor tniA are involved in anti-restriction by plasmid-borne Tn5053.\npUC-Tn5053 contains two Chi sites and two EcoKI sites. We inactivated each of these sites individually or in pairs and tested the resulting plasmids for the ability to alleviate EcoKI restriction. Only mutations that destroyed both EcoKI or both Chi sites inactivated anti-restriction, confirming that these effects are mediated by the DNA sequence of pUC-Tn5053 (Figure 2B). As expected, similar to darB fragment-induced RA, the anti-restriction activity of Tn5053 was also dependent on the presence of the ClpXP protease (Figure 2A). Since pUC-Tn5053 mediated RA was higher than that observed with pRA, it was used as the main model system in further experiments. Since inactivation of both EcoKI or Chi sites was required to inactivate RA in the wild-type background, we designate these plasmids pTn5053 EcoKI\u2212 and pTn5053 Chi\u2212 and use them as controls throughout the rest of this work.\nTo determine whether anti-restriction activity reported for non-conjugative transposons other than Tn5053 is also due to plasmid-induced RA, we Illumina-sequenced plasmids with cloned transposons available to us (Supplementary Figure S3B) and determined their activity against EcoKI in the RA test (Figure 2C). All sequenced transposon-containing plasmids carried EcoKI sites. Consistent with expectations, two plasmids (carrying Tn5090 and Tn5060) that lacked Chi sites had no anti-EcoKI activity (Figure 2C, S3B). With the exception of the Tn501 plasmid, plasmids that had both EcoKI and Chi sites inhibited the EcoKI defence. The lack of activity of the Tn501 plasmid could be explained by the lower copy number of its pBR322 backbone, though pBR322 carrying Tn21 inhibited EcoKI defence (Figures 2C, S3B). Thus, additional, yet unknown plasmid features may be required to induce RA.\nTo prove that plasmid-induced RA is not specific to phage \u03bb proteins produced during the infection, we tested a derivative of an unrelated phage T7 for ability to overcome the EcoKI defence in the presence of pUC-Tn5053. As can be seen from Figure 3A, the anti-restriction activity of pUC-Tn5053 was readily observed with this phage.\nWe also tested whether pUC-Tn5053 inhibited the ability of EcoKI to decrease plasmid transformation efficiency. For this purpose, AB1157 cells bearing pUC18, pUC-Tn5053, or its derivative lacking EcoKI or Chi sites were transformed with a compatible EcoKI-methylated or non-methylated pTG plasmid carrying a single EcoKI recognition site. Cells with pUC18 control vector were transformed by non-methylated pTG \u223c30 times less efficiently than by the methylated variant, as expected. The presence of pUC-Tn5053, but not its derivatives incapable of RA induction, increased the transformation efficiency of non-methylated pTG three times, confirming that plasmid-induced RA is not specific to phage infection (Figure 3B).\nPlasmid-induced RA acts through HsdR depletion and deactivates EcoKI defence in the absence of phage infection\nPlasmid-mediated RA is dependent on ClpXP protease, which should inactivate the EcoKI defence through HsdR depletion. To test this prediction, we determined the levels of HsdR in AB1157 cells transformed with pUC-Tn5053. As controls we used cells transformed with pUC-Tn5053-Chi\u2212 plasmids that lack Chi sites and do not affect the EcoKI activity (above). AB1157 \u0394clpX cells carrying pUC-Tn5053 served as another control. Cell lysates were subjected to mass-spectrometric proteomic analysis and the HsdR signal was compared with the signal from the HsdM subunit, which should not be affected by ClpXP proteolysis. According to LFQ analysis, HsdR was \u223c2 times less abundant in cells with pUC-Tn5053 compared to cells with pUC-Tn5053 bearing mutated Chi sites or cells with deleted clpX gene (Figure 3C). The result is thus consistent with an expectation that in the presence of an RA-capable plasmid the intracellular amounts of HsdR are reduced due to ClpXP-mediated proteolysis.\nPlasmid-induced RA can proceed via Chi- and RecBCD-independent pathway\nSince plasmid-induced RA was dependent on the presence of at least one Chi site, we tested the involvement of RecA and RecBCD proteins using appropriate mutants. The \u03bbvir titers were the same on EcoKI\u2212 AB1157\u0394hsdM rec+ cell lawns and on lawns formed by the isogenic rec mutants, indicating that mutations do not affect phage growth. Each strain was transformed with pUC-Tn5053 or EcoKI\u2212/Chi\u2212 derivative plasmids and infected with \u03bbvir(Figure 4A). pUC-Tn5053 EcoKI\u2212 was inactive in all backgrounds, confirming the strict requirement for at least one EcoKI site for RA. The recA deletion abolished pUC-Tn5053-induced RA, suggesting that RecA-mediated homologous recombination is required for RA. However, deletions of genes coding for the RecB and RecC subunits, which are essential for the activity of the RecBCD complex, still permitted RA with pTn5053. The result suggests that RA is not strictly dependent on RecBCD and Chi sites recognition mediated by RecC. Accordingly, Chi-lacking pTn5053 was anti-restriction active in the recB or recC deletion backgrounds (Figure 4A). Why then the Chi-deficient pTn5053 did not induce RA in the wild-type strain? We hypothesize that in the absence of RecBCD processing, Chi-lacking plasmids that sustain double-stranded breaks still undergo recombination that generates non-methylated EcoKI sites, while in the presence of RecBCD, linearized Chi-deficient plasmids are completely degraded. Thus, alternative RecA-dependent or RecA-independent recombination pathways manifest themselves only in the absence of RecBCD processing. The major alternative RecA-loading recombination pathway is mediated by the RecFOR proteins. Double recF recB or recO recB mutants alleviated restriction when transformed with pUC-Tn5053, suggesting the existence of pathway(s) supporting plasmid recombination in the absence of either RecBCD or RecFOR (Figure 4B).\nThe recD deletion also abolished RA (Figure 4A). The RecBC complex lacking RecD has significantly reduced exonuclease/helicase activity but retains the ability to bind dsDNA substrates and promotes Chi-independent recombination. We speculate that at conditions of decreased dsDNA nucleolytic processing recombination of damaged plasmid DNA does not efficiently generate non-methylated EcoKI sites, while the binding of the RecBC complex still blocks alternative recombination pathways active in the \u0394recB/recC background.\nPlasmid-induced RA can be activated through RecA-independent pathway\nIf recombination of Chi-lacking plasmids in the \u0394recA background is blocked due to their RecBCD-mediated degradation, both RecA and RecBCD should be eliminated to investigate the contribution of RecA-independent pathways. Despite multiple attempts, we were unable to obtain a \u0394recAB deletion using P1 transduction. We therefore inactivated RecBCD in the \u0394recA background by expressing the RecBCD inhibitor\u2014a DNA mimicking phage \u03bb protein Gam. We also investigated the ability of an alternative recombination system \u03bb Red to promote Chi- and RecA-independent recombination and induce RA. For this purpose, \u03bb Gam, \u03bb Red, or \u03bb Red and Gam were overproduced from a compatible vector in the presence of pUC-Tn5053 or its EcoKI\u2212/Chi\u2212 derivatives in the wild-type or \u0394recA AB1157 strains (Figure 5). Though \u03bb Gam was previously reported to affect the EcoKI defence, no effects of \u03bb proteins on the EcoKI defence was observed in our system. The pUC-Tn5053 EcoKI\u2212 plasmid had no RA activity at all conditions tested, confirming the strict requirement for the EcoKI restriction complex interaction with plasmid DNA for RA induction. While the pUC-Tn5053 Chi\u2212 plasmid had no RA activity in cells with active RecABCD, inhibition of RecBCD by Gam or the presence of Chi-independent \u03bb Red recombination system made this plasmid RA-proficient. We suppose that even in the absence of Gam, the \u03bb RED system overexpressed from an inducible promoter outcompetes RecBCD for binding to dsDNA ends, thus promoting RecA-independent recombination. This recapitulates the result obtained in the \u0394recB background and confirms a model according to which plasmid-mediated RA requires ongoing recombination. Finally, while both pUC-Tn5053 and pUC-Tn5053 Chi\u2212 plasmids were inactive on the \u0394recA background, expression of \u03bb Gam restored RA in this strain, further confirming that RecA-independent pathways can mediate plasmid recombination. The activity of these pathways becomes evident only when RecBCD is inactivated.\nChi-site bearing plasmids activate the SOS response, yet RA is not a SOS response function\nChi-dependent generation of non-methylated sites through recombination requires dsDNA breaks that attract the RecBCD complex. Processing of dsDNA breaks by RecBCD leads to RecA-mediated induction of the SOS response. To investigate if RA-inducing plasmids activate the SOS response, we used the MP062 E. coli strain with a Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) gene cloned under the control of the SOS-responsive sulA promoter. Treatment of MP062 cells with DNA damaging nalidixic acid resulted in accumulation of the YFP signal, indicating the activation of the SOS response. The presence of pUC-Tn5053 and pUC-Tn5053 EcoKI\u2212, but not of pUC-Tn5053 Chi\u2212 or the pUC18 control, also resulted in slow accumulation of the YFP signal at later time points (Supplementary Figure S4A). None of the plasmids induced the SOS response in the MP074 strain, an MP062 derivative deficient in recA. We conclude that low-level SOS response is activated through accumulation of dsDNA breaks in high-copy number plasmids carrying Chi-sites. To further confirm this observation, we investigated the SOS-response signal from individual cells using flow cytometry. We determined the proportion of SOS-activated MP062 cells treated with a sublethal concentration of nalidixic acid (2.5 \u03bcg/ml) or grown in the presence of pUC18, pUC-Tn5053, or EcoKI\u2212/Chi\u2212 derivatives (Supplementary Figure S4B). Cells were gated at 5% of the highest YFP signal in the pUC18 control. \u223c30% of cells treated with nalidixic acid were above this threshold. While pTn5053 Chi\u2212 culture was close to the pUC control (\u223c5.7%), the proportion of pTn5053 and pTn5053 EcoKI\u2212 cells showing signal above the threshold was higher (\u223c7% and 8%, correspondingly), suggesting weak activation of the SOS response in a subpopulation of cells carrying plasmids with a Chi-site.\nIn early works, RA was considered as one of the outcomes of the SOS-response. To exclude a possibility that RA is dependent on SOS activation, we tested AB1157-derived lexA1 strain AB2494. The SOS response relies on the interaction of activated RecA and transcriptional repressor LexA, which induces LexA autoproteolysis and derepresses the SOS regulon. LexA1 is defective in autoproteolysis and remains bound to SOS-activated promoters even in the presence of activated RecA. In the lexA1 mutant background pUC-Tn5053 retained full anti-restriction activity, suggesting that SOS response activation is not required for EcoKI defence inhibition (Supplementary Figure S5). Thus, we conclude that even though pUC-Tn5053 activates SOS response in a sub-population of cells, plasmid-mediated RA does not depend on the SOS response activation.",
        "DISCUSS": "Discussion\nIn this work, we demonstrate that plasmids can alleviate EcoKI restriction. A model of plasmid-induced RA is presented in Figure 6A and is supported by multiple lines of evidence. We envision that a cascade of events resulting in the EcoKI defence inhibition begins with accumulation of spontaneous double-stranded breaks in plasmid DNA. Free DNA ends attract RecBCD, which completely degrades linearized plasmids lacking Chi sites. If a plasmid processed by RecBCD contains at least one Chi site, the RecA-dependent homologous recombination is activated. Recombination between homologous regions containing hemi-methylated EcoKI sites that transiently accumulate each time plasmid DNA is replicated generates non-methylated sites. Binding of EcoKI restriction complexes to non-methylated sites activates DNA translocation, which exposes the HsdR subunit to ClpXP proteolysis. Thus, plasmid DNA serves as a \u2018sponge\u2019 that constantly attracts the EcoKI restriction complexes and channels them for proteolytic degradation. This process happens only in conditions of active plasmid recombination that generates non-methylated EcoKI sites. The same recombination process should take place in the E. coli chromosomal DNA, yet in previous works RA was observed only at conditions of increased DNA damage. Presumably, the frequency of generation of non-methylated EcoKI sites in plasmid but not host DNA is high enough at normal growth conditions to produce RA in a non-damaged cell. It should be noted that the HsdR levels are not increased in \u0394clpX strains, confirming that in the lack of additional inputs RA is not induced by the chromosomal DNA. The difference is likely due to the higher copy number of plasmid DNA, which should increase the frequency of recombination.\nOur model explains several previously observed phenomena of EcoKI defence inhibition. First, it was reported that the EcoKI defence is reduced in recB-deficient cells carrying the pACYC184 plasmid. pACYC184 carries one EcoKI site but lacks Chi sequences and thus is similar to pUC Tn5053 Chi\u2212, which in our work was active only in recB-deficient cells. Presumably, in the wild-type cells random DSBs sustained by pACYC184 or Tn5053 Chi\u2212 plasmids lead to degradation by RecBCD, while the recB deletion allows recombination or repair to proceed via Chi-independent ways, leading to the launch of RA. The second phenomenon concerns the proposed anti-restriction gene ardD of non-conjugative transposons. We show that ardD does not contribute to\u00a0anti-restriction, which is mediated by the plasmid DNA itself. Whether ardD, one of the rare examples of a gene encoded in an anti-sense orientation within another gene (tniA), is real remains to be shown, but it clearly has no role in RA. In fact, our results show that caution should be taken during studies of anti-restriction mechanisms acting against Type I RM systems, such as, for example, DarB, since plasmid- and protein-mediated anti-restriction mechanism can be separated only in conditions of blocked RA (a \u0394clpX background or expression from plasmids lacking RM recognition sites).\nIn the wild-type cells, plasmid-induced RA is dependent on RecA and RecBCD (Figures 1 and\u00a02), the components of the dominant homologous recombination pathway in E. coli. Deletion of recA in the presence of RecBCD completely abolishes RA (Figure 4A). However, inactivation of RecB or RecC relieves the Chi site requirement for RA, implying the existence of RecBCD-independent mechanism(s) that mediate plasmid recombination and activate RA. RecA can be loaded on single-stranded DNA by the RecFOR proteins. Yet, double inactivation of recB and either recF or recO did not affected RA, suggesting the existence of additional RecA-loading pathways. Alternatively, RecA-independent pathways could be activated in the recB deletion background. We hypothesized that the lack of recombination in \u0394recA cells could be explained by the RecBCD-mediated degradation of linearized plasmid DNA. In this scenario, simultaneous inactivation of RecA and RecBCD should allow RecA-independent plasmid recombination to proceed. Indeed, expression of RecBCD inhibitor \u03bb Gam restored plasmid-induced RA in the \u0394recA background. RecA-independent recombination in E. coli was reported in multiple works, but in contrast to the RecA-mediated pathway, its mechanisms are much less understood, and many proteins (e.g. RarA, RuvABC, RecJ, RecQ, UvrD, RadA, etc.) may be involved. In addition to homologous recombination, DNA lesions can be processed via alternative pathways, such as fork reversal, template switching or translesion DNA synthesis. Some of these pathways can be launched by the presence of DNA nicks and thus do not require free DNA ends. We cannot exclude that in the lack of RecBCD and/or RecA, these recombinational repair pathways also generate non-methylated EcoKI sites in plasmid DNA, however, the strict requirements for the Chi site in the wild-type background questions this hypothesis. Additional studies are required to determine E. coli genes involved in plasmid recombination in different host backgrounds. Thus, generation of non-methylated EcoKI sites in plasmid DNA can proceed via multiple pathways, which could be RecBCD-, RecA- and Chi-dependent or independent, and depending on the presence of active RecBCD dsDNA breaks processing could result in various outcomes, such as complete degradation of plasmid DNA, repair or homologous recombination leading to RA activation (Figure 6B).\nIt was shown before that conjugative plasmids can induce SOS response during conjugative transfer, when single-stranded plasmid DNA entering the cell attracts RecA. Thus, many conjugative plasmids express SOS response inhibitors from early single-strand specific promoters. In addition, some plasmids trigger SOS response due to expression of toxic proteins or sequestration of host replication machinery components. We here show that the presence of a Chi-bearing plasmid DNA is sufficient to induce SOS response (Supplementary Figure S4). Chi sites are \u223c6.7 times overrepresented compared to other octonucleotide sequences in the E. coli genome and some plasmids and phages, for example, P1, show even more dramatic accumulation of Chi sequences. It was proposed that clashes between replication and transcription machinery could decrease plasmid stability. Chi-mediated recombination could rescue plasmids that suffer dsDNA breakage events and would otherwise be destroyed by RecBCD. Thus, Chi sites could be beneficial for plasmids. Given that Chi sites recognition also launches SOS response, maintenance of extrachromosomal mobile elements containing these sites could increase host mutation rates and promote acquisition of antibiotic resistance.\nIt should be noted that the RA phenomenon discussed in this work is mediated by plasmid DNA present inside the cell, which, therefore, must be considered as self. However, a question remains whether RA can be activated in natural settings by non-self plasmid or phage DNA upon entry into the cell. We tested whether the presence of a Chi site could represent a novel HGT-enhancing strategy and investigated the rates of pUC-Tn5053 de novo acquisition by EcoKI+ cells. Chi+ and Chi\u2212 non-methylated plasmids were transformed with a similarly reduced efficiency compared to cognate methylated variants, demonstrating that a\u00a0RA-competent plasmid does not increase the rate of its own transformation into\u00a0EcoKI+ host (Supplementary Figure S6). In fact, once a plasmid is established within a cell, activation of RA could have negative effects by making the host (and, therefore, the plasmid it carries) susceptible to other mobile genetic elements, including phages. Thus, plasmid-induced RA is unlikely to have evolved as a dedicated way to downregulate host R\u2013M systems and instead may represent an example of a conflict between host immunity systems and recently (in evolutionary time scales) acquired mobile elements. The principal difference between the self and non-self DNA is in the density of non-methylated sites, and it is speculated that RA is not activated during phage infection, since proteolysis-competent restriction complexes are short-lived on a DNA densely populated with non-methylated sites. However, it remains possible that mobile elements with low density of recognition sites will trigger RA, and although this will not increase the efficiency of colonisation of their hosts, removal of HsdR could favor co-infection by EcoKI-sensitive phages. It remains to be established whether such complex scenarios are possible, how widespread is the RA-like control in other phage defence systems, and whether similar conflicts between mobile elements and immunity systems are common in nature.",

        "METHODS": "Materials and methods\nBacterial strains, plasmids and phages\nAll bacterial strains, plasmids, and phages used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The majority of experiments were performed with E. coli AB1157 strain encoding EcoKI system on a chromosome. An isogenic EcoKI\u2212 strain AB1157\u0394hsdM was used as a control for the phage infection experiments to estimate phage titer. \u03bbvir is an obligatory lytic mutant of the phage \u03bb, while T7\u03940.3 lacks 0.3 gene encoding anti-restriction protein Ocr and thus is sensitive to EcoKI defence. Both phages were produced on AB1157\u0394hsdM and thus lacked EcoKI methylation.\nBacterial cultures were routinely propagated in LB medium (Lysogeny Broth: 10 g/L NaCl, 10 g/L Tryptone, 5 g/L Yest Extract) at 37\u00b0C with appropriate antibiotics. To produce T7\u03940.3 phage stock, an overnight bacterial culture was diluted 100-fold in LB and incubated at 37\u00b0C until OD600 \u223c0.6. The culture was infected with phage at low MOI (multiplicity of infection) and further incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. The resulting lysate was purified from cell debris by centrifugation (6000g, 10 min, 4\u00b0C) and treated with chloroform (10 \u03bcl per 1 ml of lysate). The resulting phage stock was stored at\u00a0+4\u00b0C. \u03bbvir lysate was produced on a solid medium plate. An overnight culture was diluted 100-fold in 0.6% LB agar supplemented with 0.2% maltose and 10 mM MgCl2, mixed with 10 \u03bcl of a high-titer phage \u03bbvir stock (\u223c1010 pfu/ml) and poured on Petri dishes with solidified 1.2% LB agar. After overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C, the top agar was scraped from plates and centrifuged (10,000g, 10 min, 4\u00b0C). The supernatant was processed as described above.\nPlasmid construction\nPlasmids used in the study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. All primers are listed in Supplementary Table S2. Dar system genes were amplified by PCR with Q5 (NEB), or CloneAmp (TakaraBio) DNA polymerase from P1 genomic DNA, gel-purified with GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit (Thermo Scientific) and ligated into EcoRI linearized pBAD L24 backbone, using HiFi DNA Assembly master mix or GA master mix (NEB). Point mutagenesis of Chi and EcoKI sites in pRA and pUC-Tn5053, as well as deletion of ardD locus in pUC-Tn5053 was carried with Q5-site directed mutagenesis kit (NEB), CloneAmp (TakaraBio) was used instead of the kit-provided Q5 polymerase for the PCR with pUC-Tn5053. For the expression of \u03bb gam, \u03bb Red (exo+\u00a0beta genes), or \u03bb Red and Gam we used pACBSR plasmid from the \u2018gene doctoring\u2019 system. The plasmid was modified to remove I-SceI gene, yet to retain araBAD promoter controlling \u03bb gam\u00a0+\u00a0exo\u00a0+\u00a0beta expression, and then \u03bb gam or \u03bb exo\u00a0+\u00a0beta was further removed via Q5-site directed mutagenesis kit (NEB). Commercial chemocompetent Xl1-Blue cells (Evrogen) were used for transformation. Plasmids were routinely isolated with GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep kit (Thermo Scientific) or Monarch Plasmid Miniprep kit (NEB). All constructs were verified with Sanger sequencing (Evrogen).\nChromosomal deletions transfer via P1 transduction\nThe transfer of genetic material from the donor strain to the recipient was carried out using generalized transduction with the P1vir phage. KEIO collection strains were used as donors for the transfer of kanamycin-resistance cassette substituting non-essential genes of interest in the genome of AB1157 recipient. Lysate of P1vir phage was produced on the KEIO donor strains grown in LB supplemented with 10 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM MgSO4. For transduction, 1.5 ml of the recipient strain overnight culture was harvested by centrifugation (6000g, 10 min, 4\u00b0C) and resuspended in a 700 \u03bcl of mQ supplemented with 10 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM MgSO4. 100 \u03bcl aliquots were mixed with various amounts (1\u201310\u2013100 \u03bcl) of P1vir lysate (\u223c5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01010 pfu/ml). An aliquot of recipient cells without the phage was used as a negative control. For adsorption of phage particles, aliquots were incubated with recipient cells at 37\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by dilution in 1 ml of LB with the addition of 200 mM sodium citrate to prevent secondary adsorption of phage particles and re-infection. Next, the cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C on a shaker. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and plated on 1.2% LB agar supplemented with antibiotic and 200 mM sodium citrate. The phage stock was also plated on a control plate supplemented with antibiotic as a control for the surviving donor cells. After overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C, the resulting colonies were tested by PCR for the presence of a replacement of target gene with the kanamycin resistance marker. PCR-positive clones were re-streaked at least 3 times on 200 mM sodium citrate plates with kanamycin to completely remove phage particles. To construct double deletions, kanamycin resistance marker was removed through Flp-mediated recombination with pCP20. Electrocompetent cells were transformed with pCP20 and plated at 30\u00b0C with ampicillin (pCP20 selection) and kanamycin (selective marker for the gene-of-interest). To initiate recombination/pCP20 loss, a single colony was inoculated in 10 ml LB, grown overnight at 42\u00b0C without antibiotics and plated at 30\u00b0C. The next day, single colonies were resuspended in 10 \u03bcl of LB and plated on kanamycin (37\u00b0C), ampicillin (30\u00b0C) and without antibiotics (37\u00b0C). Colonies that showed growth on the plate without antibiotics, but not on kanamycin and ampicillin plates were further PCR-verified for the removal of kanamycin resistance marker in the gene-of-interest locus. A second round of transduction was performed as described above.\nEfficiency of plating (EOP) assay\nThe titer of phage particles in lysates and efficiency of EoKI defence were determined using the double layer agar method. An overnight culture of bacteria was diluted 100-fold and mixed with 0.6% LB agar, supplemented with required antibiotics and optionally with 0.2% maltose and 10 mM MgCl2 for the phage \u03bb infection, followed by plating on a pre-cast 1.2% LB agar plates. 0.2% l-arabinose was used to induce transcription from the pBAD and pACBSR vector. For the experiments with pACBSR vectors, overnight culture was also grown in the presence of 0.2% l-arabinose. 10 \u03bcl serial 10-fold dilutions of phage stock were pipetted on the top agar and left until dry. After overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C, the number of phage plaques was counted, and the titer was determined. The fold protection was calculated as the ratio of the phage titer obtained on the lawn of cells without active defense system (AB1157\u0394hsdM or its double-deletion derivatives) to the phage titer on the lawn of experimental culture. All EOP experiments were carried out in biological triplicates.\nLiquid culture infectoin dynamics\nAn overnight culture of bacteria was diluted 100-fold in LB medium supplemented with antibiotics and additives required for the phage infection and incubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking until the optical density of the culture (OD600) reached \u223c0.6. If required, 0.2% l-arabinose was preliminary added at OD600 \u223c0.3. Next, 200 \u03bcl aliquots were transferred to the 96-well plates (Costar) and infected with phages at desired MOI. Optical density was monitored for 20 h using an EnSpire Multimode Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, USA) at 37\u00b0C.\nEfficiency of transformation (EOT) assay\nTo produce EcoKI methylated variant, plasmids were propagated on AB1157, while AB1157\u0394hsdM was used to produce non-methylated variant. Plasmids were purified from 2 ml of overnight culture with GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep kit (Thermo Scientific) or Monarch Plasmid Miniprep kit (NEB) and the concentration was measured using Qubit dsDNA Broad Range Assay Kit on the Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen). The equimolar amount of each plasmid (24 fmol) was used for the transformation of 50 \u03bcl chemocompetent cells prepared according to Inoue protocol. Colonies were counted automatically on a colony counter Scan 1200 (Interscience). M+/M\u2013 value was calculated as the ratio between the number of colonies obtained with the methylated plasmid relative to the non-methylated one. All EOT experiments were performed in biological triplicates.\nPlasmids Illumina sequencing\nPlasmid DNA was purified with GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep kit (Thermo Scientific). DNA libraries were prepared in accordance with a standard protocol and sequenced on MiniSeq platform (Illumina, USA) with paired-end 150 cycles (75\u00a0+\u00a075). Plasmid assembly was performed using SPAdes implemented in Unicycler. Plasmid origins were determined based on blastn search.\nMass-spectrometry\nThe relative amount of HsdR protein was determined in cell lysates via mass-spectrometry. The overnight culture was diluted 100-fold in 10m ml of LB media and incubated with antibiotics at 37\u00b0C with constant shaking until the OD600 \u223c0.6. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation (6000g, 10 min, 4\u00b0C) and resuspended in 200 \u03bcl of PBS buffer (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were lysed by sonication on ice with a 10 second pulse and 40% power using Q500 sonicator with 0.2 cm sonotrode (Qsonica). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C for 30 min at a speed of 20 000g. The resulting supernatant was further examined for the HsdR abundance using label-free protein quantification, as described. LFQ protein counts for HsdR and HsdM were normalized to the total protein counts.\nEvaluation of the SOS response and flow cytometry\nTo measure activation of the SOS response, strains MP062 and MP074 (isogenic to MP062, but with recA deletion) encoding a chromosomal variant of the YFP reporter under control of sulA promoter, were used. Culture was grown in LB till OD600 \u223c0.6 and then 200 \u03bcl of culture was transferred to 96-well plate (Costar) and incubation was continued at 37\u00b0C in EnSpire Multimode Plate Reader (PerkinElmer). Culture growth was monitored by OD600, while YFP signal was excited at a wavelength of 513 nm and detected at 530 nm. YFP fluorescence signal was normalized to the OD value at each time point.\nTo determine SOS response signal from individual cells, MP062 strain culture was used for the flow cytometry. \u0394recA MP062 derivative MP074 was used as a negative control for SOS response induction. Bacterial culture started from individual colony was grown overnight at 37\u00b0C in LB. Fresh overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold in 10 ml 0.22 \u03bcm filtered M9 medium (1xM9 salts, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1mM CaCl2) supplemented with 5% LB broth and required antibiotics and grown till exponential phase (OD600 \u223c 0.6). As positive control for SOS response activation, cells were treated with 2.5 \u03bcg/ml Nalidixic acid at OD600 \u223c0.1. Measurement of YFP fluorescence was performed with CytoFLEX cytometer (Beckman Coulter) in the FITC channel. 100\u00a0000 events were collected for each sample in three biological replicates. Data was analyzed and visualized in FlowJo v10. Single cell events were selected based on the scatter plot distribution of FSC-A/FSC-H values. To quantify SOS signal, YFP expressing cells were gated for FITC signal.",

        "TITLE": "Combined targeting of glioblastoma stem cells of different cellular states disrupts malignant progression",
        "ABSTRACT": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain tumor with intra-tumoral hierarchy of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). The heterogeneity of GSCs within GBM inevitably leads to treatment resistance and tumor recurrence. Molecular mechanisms of different cellular state GSCs remain unclear. Here, we find that classical (CL) and mesenchymal (MES) GSCs are enriched in reactive immune region and high CL-MES signature informs poor prognosis in GBM. Through integrated analyses of GSCs RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, we identify specific GSCs targets, including MEOX2 for the CL GSCs and SRGN for the MES GSCs. MEOX2-NOTCH and SRGN-NF\u03baB axes play important roles in promoting proliferation and maintaining stemness and subtype signatures of CL and MES GSCs, respectively. In the tumor microenvironment, MEOX2 and SRGN mediate the resistance of CL and MES GSCs to macrophage phagocytosis. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we identify FDA-approved drugs targeting MEOX2 and SRGN. Combined CL and MES GSCs targeting demonstrates enhanced efficacy, both in vitro and in vivo. Our results highlighted a therapeutic strategy for the elimination of heterogeneous GSCs populations through combinatorial targeting of MEOX2 and SRGN in GSCs.\nThe molecular mechanisms underlying the function of different cellular states in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) remain poorly understood. Here, the authors perform integrated single cell and bulk analysis of GSCs and identify potential therapeutic targets.",
        "INTRO": "Introduction\nGlioblastoma (GBM) is a primary malignant brain tumor of the central nervous system, with a high degree of malignancy and an annual incidence of 3\u20135 per 100,000 people. Even with the most aggressive treatment strategies, the median survival is less than two years. GBM is characterized by a high degree of intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity. Studies over the last several decades have shown that GBM exhibits a wide range of cellular, genetic, epigenetic, and metabolic heterogeneity between tumors and even within individual tumors. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics (stRNA-seq) and advanced computational analyses allow for comprehensive identification of cellular states affected by various tumor microenvironments. Analyses based on bulk expression profiles identified that three subtypes of GBM exist, namely proneural (PN), classical (CL), and mesenchymal (MES). Recent single-cell expression profiling studies found each GBM sample contains dynamic cellular states of tumor cells, and this intra-tumoral heterogeneity has potential prognostic implications.\nGBM contain stem cell-like tumor-initiating cells named glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) that represent their driving force and exhibit preferential resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapies. GSCs are functionally distinct from differentiated tumor cells at multiple regulatory levels including unique epigenetic, transcriptional, and metabolic profiles. Previous studies predominantly considered GSCs as a single-cell population to explore its functional mechanism. However, established GSCs markers are associated with distinct glioblastoma cellular states. Among GSCs surface markers, CD24 is the highest in neural-progenitor-like (NPC-like) cells, CD133 in oligodendrocyte-progenitor-like (OPC-like) cells, EGFR in astrocyte-like (AC-like) cells, and CD44 in mesenchymal-like (MES-like) cells. These results indicate that markers commonly used to define GSCs may identify distinct cellular states instead of a single, unified subpopulation. Previous studies have shown that heterogeneous GSCs reside in distinct niches, highlighting the need for tailored therapeutic approaches to target specific subsets within their respective microenvironments. Although features of different cellular states of GSCs are distinct and subpopulations of GSCs might not be equally important for tumor progression, few studies have explored their molecular mechanisms. A comprehensive understanding of the biology of different cellular states of GSCs is needed for developing new GBM therapies.\nIn this work, we find that single GBM sample contains GSCs with different cellular states. CL and MES GSCs are predominantly found in immune-reactive regions, and a high CL-MES signature is associated with poor prognosis in GBM. MEOX2 and SRGN are identified as targets for CL and MES GSCs, respectively. The MEOX2-NOTCH and SRGN-NF\u03baB axes drive proliferation while sustaining stemness and subtype features of CL and MES GSCs. Within the tumor microenvironment, these regulators confer resistance to macrophage mediated phagocytosis in CL and MES GSCs. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we identify FDA-approved drugs targeting MEOX2 and SRGN. Combined CL and MES GSCs targeting demonstrates enhanced efficacy, both in vitro and in vivo. Targeted therapy tailored for CL and MES GSCs in their specific niches has the significant potential to improve the clinical outcome of GBM patients.",
        "RESULTS": "Results\nGlioblastoma stem cells exhibit transcriptional heterogeneity and high CL-MES signature inform poor prognosis in glioblastoma\nStudies of intratumoral subtype heterogeneity have proposed essential insights into the underlying biological mechanisms. Analysis of the GSCs RNA-seq dataset (GSE119834) revealed that GSCs isolated from different GBM patients exhibit distinct transcriptional subtypes (PN, CL, and MES) and cellular states (NPC-like, OPC-like, AC-like, and MES-like) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a and Supplementary Data\u00a01). In previous reports, four tumor cellular states in each tumor defined by scRNA-seq are highly consistent with three bulk subtypes defined by TCGA. The TCGA-CL and TCGA-MES subtypes correspond to tumors enriched for the AC-like and MES-like states, respectively. The TCGA-PN subtype corresponds to the combination of the NPC-like and OPC-like states. Our results also observed the same phenomenon. To examine GSCs composition within glioblastoma, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing from 24 samples (22 patients) dissociated and processed directly after surgical tumor resections. We interrogated six scRNA-seq datasets (GSE103224, GSE117891, GSE131928, GSE141383, GSE173278, and GSE182109) of additional 58 IDH-wt GBM specimens for joint analysis to enhance the reliability of the screening results. After isolating tumor cells in scRNA-seq datasets, we defined GSC-like tumor cells as any cell expressing CD133, CD15 or OCT4, in conjunction with SOX2 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b). Next, we classified GSC-like tumor cells into the four cellular states (NPC-like, OPC-like, AC-like, or MES-like) defined by Neftel et al.. The proportion of four cellular states of GSC-like tumor cells were similar to the proportion of all tumor cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01c). Most tumors containing all four cellular states of GSCs and the frequencies of GSC-like tumor cells states varied between tumors (Fig.\u00a01a). These results revealed the heterogeneous GSCs populations, suggesting that no single therapeutic modality may be universally effective.\nSubpopulations of GSCs might not all be equally important for GBM progression. GSCs are not uniformly distributed within tumors and critically interact with their microenvironment. Interactions between GSCs and tumor immune microenvironment are closely related to GBM malignant progression. In the Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (Ivy GAP) database, which contains data from 42 GBM regionally microdissected with RNA-seq, samples in the immune response region showed higher CL and MES signatures (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01d). Analysis of GSC-like tumor cells in the scRNA-seq dataset revealed that the spatially unique reactive-immune program was associated with AC- and MES-like states (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01e). Co-labeling for CD45 and EGFR+SOX2+/CD44+SOX2+ region confirmed that CL and MES GSCs were enriched in reactive immune region in GBM (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01f, g). These results imply potential interactions between CL and MES GSCs with tumor immune microenvironment.\nTo further investigate the clinical significance of intratumoral subtype heterogeneity characteristics, we analyzed the expression profiling data in clinical dataset. In our in-house generated clinical dataset, patients with high AC-like and MES-like GSCs proportion (>50%) had a shorter survival compared with patients with low proportion (<50%) (Fig.\u00a01b and Supplementary Data\u00a02). In TCGA GBM dataset, after obtaining the subtype signature scores of each GBM sample, we compared the association between the level of patient subtype score and survival prognosis. Patients with higher transcriptional signature scores for both CL and MES subtypes had a shorter survival, while higher scores for both PN and CL or higher scores for both PN and MES signatures did not show significance for the patient\u2019s survival (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01h). These results indicate the vital roles of CL and MES GSCs in GBM malignant progression. Suggesting that combined CL and MES GSCs targeting may be effective in overcoming tumor malignant progression caused by intratumoral heterogeneity.\nMEOX2 and SRGN are specific targets in classical and mesenchymal glioblastoma stem cells\nTo identify representative targets with clinical utility in CL and MES GSCs, we interrogated both single-cell and bulk RNA-seq datasets as illustrated in the flow chart shown in Fig.\u00a01c. We selected genes that met the following conditions: First, genes that were highly expressed in classical signature (CL subtype and AC-like cellular state) or mesenchymal signature (MES subtype and MES-like cellular state) GSCs under the following conditions: (1) AC-like/MES-like GSC-like tumor cells vs. other cellular state GSC-like tumor cells (scRNA-seq datasets, n\u2009=\u200980); (2) CL/MES GSCs vs. CL/MES differentiated glioblastoma cells (DGCs) (in-house generated); (3) CL/MES GSCs vs. non-neoplastic neural stem cells (NSCs) (GSCs/NSCs dataset GSE119834); (4) CL/MES GSCs vs. other subtype GSCs (GSCs/NSCs dataset GSE119834); (5) GBM vs. non-neoplastic brain tissue (TCGA GBM HG-U133A); (6) CL/MES GBM vs. other subtype GBM (TCGA GBM HG-U133A). Second, expression of genes was positively correlated with CL/MES subtype signature score. Third, higher expression of genes was associated with poorer patient survival. After the above screening steps, MEOX2 and SRGN were selected as typical CL and MES GSCs targets for subsequent studies (Supplementary Data\u00a03 and 4).\nSurvival analysis of the TCGA GBM dataset showed that patients with higher expression of MEOX2 and SRGN had worse survival prognoses than those with low expression of both genes (Fig.\u00a01d). In scRNA-seq data, MEOX2 and SRGN are overexpressed in AC-like and MES-like tumor cells and GSC-like tumor cells, respectively (Fig.\u00a01e and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a\u2013h). In bulk RNA-seq data, MEOX2/SRGN were enriched in CL/MES GSCs and GBM, respectively. MEOX2 expression was positively correlated with the CL signature, whereas SRGN expression was correlated with the MES signature in GSCs (Fig.\u00a01f and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02i\u2013l). Quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and immunoblot analysis confirmed the characteristic expression of MEOX2 and SRGN in CL and MES GSCs (Fig.\u00a01g, h and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a, b).\nTo validate the reliability of screening results, we intensely interrogated the expression profiles of MEOX2 and SRGN in multi-omics data. H3K27ac is associated with transcriptional activation and is mainly enriched in enhancer and promoter regions. Analysis of H3K27ac Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-seq) data of GSCs and NSCs revealed that H3K27ac was enriched in the MEOX2 promoter regions of CL GSCs. In comparison, SRGN was marked explicitly by H3K27ac in MES GSCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03c). Immunofluorescent staining showed a strong overlap between SOX2 and MEOX2/SRGN tumor cells in GBM surgical specimens, and co-labeling for CD45 and MEOX2/SRGN confirmed our analysis findings that CL and MES GSCs were enriched in reactive immune region in GBM (Fig.\u00a01i, j and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03d, e). By analyzing the GBM spatial transcriptomics data, we found that the spatial distribution of MEOX2/SRGN in GBM was consistent with the distribution of an AC-like/MES-like signature. MEOX2/SRGN enriched regions overlapped with reactive immune regions (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03f\u2013h).\nTo evaluate the potential of MEOX2 and SRGN as therapeutic target, pan-cancer analysis was performed to examine their expression patterns across all tumor types. Interestingly, when comparing tumor vs. normal tissues expression across all cancer types, MEOX2 and SRGN exhibit the highest fold-change differences. When comparing expression levels across all tumor tissues, MEOX2 ranked second, and SRGN ranked fifth in terms of expression among all cancer types (Fig.\u00a01k). Previous studies have demonstrated important roles for MEOX2 and SRGN in other cancers, with MEOX2 functioning in lung cancer and SRGN in melanoma, However, their remarkably high differential expression in GBM, together with our findings of subtype-specific expression, suggests their particular promise as therapeutic targets in GBM.\nMEOX2 and SRGN support cell proliferation, self-renewal, and stemness in a subtype-specific manner in classical and mesenchymal glioblastoma stem cells, respectively\nTo determine the functional importance of MEOX2 and SRGN in the corresponding GSCs, we depleted the expression of either MEOX2 or SRGN using two non-overlapping specific shRNAs in CL (3028 and RKI) and MES (2907 and 839) GSCs, respectively. MEOX2 depletion potently decreased the cell viability of CL GSCs, but with modest or no effects on MES and PN GSCs (Fig.\u00a02a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a, b). SRGN knockdown significantly reduced cell growth and proliferation of MES GSCs without affecting the expansion of CL and PN GSCs (Fig.\u00a02b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04c, d). Stem cell frequency and self-renewal of GSCs were diminished upon MEOX2 or SRGN depletion, as revealed by GSCs neurosphere formation and extreme limiting dilution assays (Fig.\u00a02c\u2013f and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04e, f). Conversely, overexpression of MEOX2 enhanced the proliferation of CL GSCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04g\u2013j). In MES GSCs, overexpression of SRGN promoted GSCs growth (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04k\u2013n). Reconstitution of MEOX2 expression in CL GSCs rescued the deficit of CL GSCs proliferation and self-renewal after MEOX2 knockdown (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04o\u2013r). Overexpression of SRGN rescued the proliferative and self-renewal capacity of MES GSCs carrying SRGN knockdown-mediated growth defects (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04s\u2013v).\nRNA-seq analysis revealed that depletion of MEOX2 induced extensive gene expression changes in CL GSCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a, b). The deficiency of MEOX2 decreased the mRNA expression and protein levels of stem cell markers (SOX2 and ID1) in CL GSCs (Fig.\u00a02g\u2013i). After MEOX2 knockout, CL subtype marker genes expression significantly decreased, suggesting that MEOX2 was essential in maintaining CL status in CL GSCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05c\u2013e). In MES GSCs, the SRGN knockout group was transcriptionally distinct from the control group, with over 900 genes differentially expressed (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05f, g). The deficiency of SRGN in MES GSCs decreased the expression of the stem cell markers (SOX2 and ID1) in MES GSCs (Fig.\u00a02j\u2013l). After SRGN knockout, the expression of many MES subtype marker genes significantly decreased (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05h\u2013j). These data indicate that MEOX2 and SRGN play important roles in maintaining the stemness and subtype signatures in CL and MES GSCs, respectively.\nTo investigate the in vivo function of MEOX2 and SRGN in tumor propagation in an orthotopic xenograft model, we implanted MEOX2-knockdown CL GSCs or SRGN-knockdown MES GSCs into the brains of immunocompromised mice. Bioluminescence imaging confirmed that the anti-tumor effects of MEOX2 knockdown in CL GSCs were more effective than in MES GSCs, whereas SRGN knockdown showed the opposite result. For mice bearing CL GSCs, MEOX2 knockdown prolonged the survival of intracranial tumor-bearing mice relative to the control group. In contrast, SRGN knockdown reduced the growth of MES GSCs-derived tumors (Fig.\u00a02m\u2013p). Collectively, these results showed that MEOX2 and SRGN play specific and vital roles in maintaining CL and MES GSCs, respectively.\nMEOX2 mediates activation of the Notch signaling pathway in classical glioblastoma stem cells\nMEOX2 belongs to the homeobox gene family of transcription factors. 3028 was patient-derived xenograft models and were not sorted by subtype-specific surface markers. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 3028 GSCs. The analysis results showed that 3028 contained all four cellular states GSCs, among which AC-like had the highest proportion. After knocking out MEOX2 in 3028, we found a subtype transition in 3028 GSCs and the proportion of AC-like GSCs decreased (Fig.\u00a03a, b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a06a, b). To interrogate the mechanism of MEOX2 in maintaining CL GSCs, we performed multi-omics analysis including bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq after MEOX2 knockout and ChIP-seq for MEOX2 in CL GSCs (Fig.\u00a03c).\nFor MEOX2 knockout RNA-seq data, we performed Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using Hallmark, KEGG, and Reactome genesets. GSEA identified the enrichment of pathways associated with Notch signaling upon MEOX2 knockout, with many genes in the Notch signaling pathway being downregulated (Fig.\u00a03d and Supplementary Fig.\u00a06c). In scRNA-seq data, the enrichment level of Notch signaling decreased correspond with the decrease of AC-like proportion (Fig.\u00a03e). Consistently, analysis of Hallmark, KEGG, and Reactome pathway genesets in GSCs RNA-seq and scRNA-seq datasets (GSC-like tumor cells) highlighted that Notch signaling was enriched in CL/AC-like GSCs, suggesting its key role in CL/AC-like GSCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06d, e).\nFor MEOX2 ChIP-seq analysis, 17,153 distinct peaks were identified compared with the input control in total. MEOX2 tended to bind distally to coding regions, with many MEOX2 peaks in intergenic, intronic, and promoter regions (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06f). To determine the biological functions of MEOX2 bound regions, we further investigated the genes proximal to MEOX2 binding sites. Consistent with previous findings, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis identified enrichment of the Notch signaling pathway (Fig.\u00a03f). The recruitment of MEOX2 at the promoters of JAG1, NOTCH1, MAML2, KAT2B, and PSEN1 was reduced upon loss of MEOX2, suggesting MEOX2 acted as a transcriptional activator of these genes. For NOTCH2, MEOX2 showed a distal binding occupancy, with peaks located within intronic regions. This indicates that MEOX2 may bind to the enhancer regions at distal sites from the transcription start sites (Fig.\u00a03g and Supplementary Fig.\u00a06g). ChIP-qPCR analysis using the MEOX2 antibody revealed decreased enrichment at the promoter regions of JAG1, NOTCH1, MAML2, and PSEN1 following MEOX2 knockdown (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06h).\nThe inhibitory effect of MEOX2 knockdown on the expression of Notch signaling genes was validated by qRT-PCR in CL GSCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07a). Overexpression of MEOX2 in MEOX2-depleted CL GSCs restored the expression levels of these genes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07b). Overexpressing NOTCH1 in CL GSCs with MEOX2 knockdown restored the defect in cell proliferation, suggesting that NOTCH signaling is a key downstream effector (Fig.\u00a03h, i and Supplementary Fig.\u00a07c). In CL GSCs, we knocked down NOTCH1 and found that the mRNA and protein levels of SOX2 and ID1 decreased (Fig.\u00a03j and Supplementary Fig.\u00a07d). Overexpression of NOTCH1 in CL GSCs restored the transcriptomic profile of the CL state in the MEOX2 knockdown GSCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07e). Re-introducing NOTCH1 into CL GSCs with MEOX2 knockdown restored the in vivo growth of tumor (Fig.\u00a03k, l). Overall, these results confirmed that MEOX2 mediates the activation of the Notch signaling pathway in CL GSCs. MEOX2-NOTCH axis plays an important role in CL GSCs\u2019 self-renewal and stemness maintenance.\nSRGN protects NFKB1 from degradation to regulate NF-\u03baB signaling in mesenchymal glioblastoma stem cells\nThe scRNA-seq results showed that 2907 contained all four cellular states GSCs, among which MES-like had the highest proportion. After knocking down SRGN in 2907, we found a subtype transition in 2907 GSCs and the proportion of MES-like GSCs decreased (Fig.\u00a04a, b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a08a, b). Given the critical role of SRGN in MES GSCs, we further explored its downstream mechanism. GSEA showed that the knockout of SRGN in MES GSCs reduced the expression of genes involved in nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling, and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08c). Analysis of Hallmark, KEGG, and Reactome pathway genesets in GSCs RNA-seq and scRNA-seq datasets (GSC-like tumor cells) revealed that these signals were characteristically enriched in MES/MES-like GSCs, indicating their important roles in MES/MES-like GSCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08d, e). In scRNA-seq data, the enrichment level of NF-\u03baB signaling decreased correspond with the decrease of MES-like proportion (Fig.\u00a04c). We next analyzed the potential binding partners for SRGN using immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by mass spectrometry and found 670 proteins from the immunoprecipitants pulled down by SRGN (Supplementary Data\u00a06). Gene Ontology (GO) terms in the biological process related to the NF-\u03baB signaling and ubiquitin-proteasome system were enriched with these 670 candidate proteins (Fig.\u00a04d and Supplementary Fig.\u00a08f). Among them, NFKB1, a vital protein of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, binds with SRGN (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08g), suggesting that SRGN plays a crucial role in MES GSCs by modulating the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.\nFurther, we performed an IP assay and confirmed the mutual interaction between SRGN and NFKB1 in two MES GSCs (Fig.\u00a04e). Immunofluorescence assays demonstrated that NFKB1 co-localized with SRGN in the cytoplasm of the MES GSCs (Fig.\u00a04f). Gene expression analysis revealed that NFKB1 has a similar expression pattern as SRGN, which was also explicitly overexpressed in MES GSCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08h). The same expression distribution of NFKB1 was also verified by scRNA-seq data (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08i). However, SRGN knockdown did not alter NFKB1 mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08j). In contrast, the depletion of endogenous SRGN led to a drastic decrease in NFKB1 protein levels in two MES GSCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08k), indicating that SRGN may regulate NFKB1 protein stability.\nTo determine the effect of SRGN on NFKB1 stability, we first blocked de novo protein synthesis using cycloheximide (CHX) and examined the NFKB1 and SRGN protein levels in MES GSCs. NFKB1 was gradually degraded within 8\u2009h of CHX treatment in control cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08l). Treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 resulted in a significant increase in NFKB1 protein levels (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08m). Blocking proteasomal degradation with MG-132 restored NFKB1 expression caused by SRGN knockdown (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08n), but cycloheximide-chase analysis revealed that NFKB1 half-life was reduced by half in SRGN-depleted GSCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08o). These results suggest that SRGN stabilizes the protein levels of NFKB1 in GSCs.\nWe identified that SRGN knockdown increased NFKB1 polyubiquitylation in MES GSCs (Fig.\u00a04g). Next, we co-expressed Flag-NFKB1 and His-ubiquitin with HA-SRGN in MES GSCs. After the IP of NFKB1 from cells treated with MG132, we observed that NFBK1 was heavily ubiquitinated. However, co-expression of SRGN partially abolished NFKB1 ubiquitination (Fig.\u00a04h). To examine the mechanistic basis of proteasomal degradation, we expressed NFKB1 with wild-type ubiquitin, K48-linked, or K63-linked polyubiquitylation. SRGN effectively disassembled the K48-linked polyubiquitylation of SRGN but had no significant effect on the nondegradative K63-linked polyubiquitylation of NFKB1 (Fig.\u00a04i). Furthermore, we expressed a K48R form of ubiquitin in SRGN-depleted MES GSCs and found that K48R ubiquitin expression blocked NFKB1 downregulation induced by SRGN knockdown (Fig.\u00a04j). These data confirmed that SRGN prevents polyubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation of NFKB1.\nNFKB1 downstream targets (BIRC3, CXCL8, GADD45B, PLAU, TNFAIP3, and VCAM1) were downregulated in SRGN knockout MES GSCs from RNA-seq data (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09a). NFKB1 downstream targets also showed MES subtype characteristic expression patterns in the GSCs RNA-seq dataset (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09b). qRT-PCR validated the effects of SRGN knockdown on decreasing mRNA expression of these targets in MES GSCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09c). SRGN overexpression restored the decreased level of these target genes\u2019 expression in MES GSCs with SRGN knockdown (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09d). Introducing NFKB1 into MES GSCs with SRGN knockdown restored the defect in cell proliferation and stem cell frequency (Fig.\u00a04k, l and Supplementary Fig.\u00a09e). Knockdown of NFKB1 decreased the mRNA and protein levels of SOX2 and ID1 in MES GSCs (Fig.\u00a04m and Supplementary Fig.\u00a09f). Overexpression of NFKB1 in MES GSCs restored the transcriptomic profile of the the MES state in the SRGN knockdown GSCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09f). Re-introducing NFKB1 into MES GSCs with SRGN knockdown restore in vivo growth of tumor (Fig.\u00a04n, o). These results confirmed that SRGN regulates the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by maintaining the protein stability of NFKB1. SRGN-NF\u03baB axis plays significant roles in MES GSCs\u2019 self-renewal and stemness maintenance.\nMEOX2 and SRGN regulate the resistance of classical and mesenchymal glioblastoma stem cells to macrophage phagocytosis, respectively\nTo explore the proportion of immune cells in different subtype GBM, we deconvoluted the TCGA GBM dataset by applying CIBERSORTx using reference cell-state signatures derived from our in-house generated single-cell transcriptomes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010a, b). We observed variations in cellular composition between different subtypes of GBM. The proportion of myeloid cells in GBM with high CL-MES signatures was significantly higher than that in GBM with low CL-MES signatures (Fig.\u00a05a, b). To identify specific immune cells linked to CL-MES signature in GBM, we examined the TCGA GBM dataset for immune cells using validated gene set signatures. These analyses demonstrated that CL-MES signature correlated with significant enrichment of macrophages (Fig.\u00a05c). The analysis of Rembrandt, CGGA, and Ivy GAP databases also obtained the same results (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010c\u2013k). These results indicated that CL and MES GSCs, which were enriched in the reactive immune region, may interact closely with macrophages in the tumor immune microenvironment.\nInteractions between GSCs and the immune system represent a new and developing battleground with great implications for treatment. Further, we focused on the roles of MEOX2 and SRGN in the interaction between CL/MES GSCs and macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. In the scRNA-seq dataset, we found most anti-phagocytosis signals (MHC Class I genes, CD24, PD-L1, CD47, and STC1) were expressed significantly higher in AC-like and MES-like GSC-like tumor cells (Fig.\u00a05d). In the GSCs RNA-seq dataset, we observed higher expression of most anti-phagocytosis signals in CL and MES GSCs compared with PN GSCs and NSCs (Fig.\u00a05e). Knockout of MEOX2 decreased the expression level of anti-phagocytosis genes but with modest or no effects on the expression of macrophage chemokines and genes related to tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) polarization in CL GSCs (Fig.\u00a05f and Supplementary Fig.\u00a010l). In MES GSCs, SRGN knockout significantly decreased the expression of anti-phagocytosis genes (Fig.\u00a05g). There were modest or no changes in the expression of macrophage chemokines and genes correlated with TAM polarization after SRGN knockout in MES GSCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010m). These results were verified by qRT-PCR in CL and MES GSCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010n, o). Under the co-culture system, MEOX2 depletion potently increased macrophage phagocytosis of CL GSCs, with modest effects on MES GSCs. Knockdown SRGN increased macrophage phagocytosis of MES GSCs, with modest effects on CL GSCs (Fig.\u00a05h, i). These results indicated that MEOX2 and SRGN regulate the resistance of macrophage phagocytosis in CL and MES GSCs, respectively.\nCombined targeting of classical and mesenchymal glioblastoma stem cells blocks tumor growth in a subtype-mixed glioblastoma model\nGiven that MEOX2-regulated genes are involved in the Notch signaling pathway. SRGN regulates the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by preventing NFKB1 from degradation. Given the absence of direct inhibitors targeting MEOX2 and SRGN, we focused on established pathway inhibitors to evaluate the therapeutic potential of dual targeting of CL and MES GSCs. Three widely used Notch inhibitors (DAPT, RG-4733, Semagacestat) and NF-\u03baB inhibitors (BAY11-7082, JSH-23, PDTC) were prioritized for in vitro and in vivo validation. CL GSCs were generally more sensitive to Notch inhibitors, while MES GSCs displayed preferential sensitivity to NF-\u03baB inhibitors. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of NF-\u03baB inhibitors was lower in MES GSCs than in CL GSCs. The differential sensitivity was confirmed by comparing the mean IC50 of Notch and NF-\u03baB inhibitors in CL and MES GSCs, respectively (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011a, b).\nSystemic delivery of drugs against brain tumors requires sufficient drug delivery to the brain and the tumor site for maximal efficacy. Although GBM is often accompanied by disruption of the blood-brain barrier, this anatomic obstacle still portends a challenge to the effective drug delivery of many compounds. To identify the Notch and NF-\u03baB inhibitors with sufficient brain penetration, we used high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to detect inhibitor concentrations in the plasma and brain. RG-4733 and PDTC had better brain penetration than other compounds (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011c, d). We determined an optimal concentration of each compound using synergy analyses to maximize the anti-tumor effect while limiting toxicities (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011e). The differential sensitivity was confirmed by comparing the mean IC50 of Notch and NF-\u03baB inhibitors in CL and MES GSCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011f). The combination of low, clinically achievable concentrations of RG-4733 (Notch inhibitor) and PDTC (NF-\u03baB inhibitor) blocked tumorsphere formation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011g). To explore the efficacy of combined targeting of CL and MES GSCs, we examined the therapeutic effects of RG-4733 and PDTC in a previously reported subtype-mixed model derived from a mixture of CL and MES GSCs (ratio 1:1) (Fig.\u00a05j). Orthotopic xenograft experiments subjected to a 9-arm experimental group including (1) vehicle control, (2) cells treated with shMEOX2, (3) cells treated with shSRGN, (4) in vivo treatment with the Notch inhibitor PDTC, (5) in vivo treatment with the NF-kB inhibitor RG-4733, (6) shMEOX2 plus PTDC, (7) shSRGN plus RG-4733, (8) shMEOX2 plus shSRGN, and (9) PDTC plus RG-4733. Bioluminescence imaging confirmed that the antitumor effects of combined therapy were more effective than monotherapy in both shRNA and small molecular inhibitor groups (Fig.\u00a05k), with significantly prolonged survival with combined treatment (Fig.\u00a05l), indicating that the combinatorial inhibition was an effective strategy for the heterogeneous cellular composition of GSCs.\nCombined pharmacological inhibition of MEOX2 and SRGN with FDA-approved drugs is an effective treatment strategy\nMEOX2 and SRGN have great potential to be therapeutic targets. We then developed a pipeline to identify compounds with likely inhibitory effects and favorable pharmacokinetic parameters (Fig.\u00a06a). We started with a panel of FDA-approved drugs with known blood-brain barrier penetrance to perform virtual molecular screening. The DNA binding region of MEOX2 (residues 187-246) and the binding pocket of SRGN (residues 28-60) were predicted by the Alphafold 2 database model. The drug\u2019s binding score was ranked according to the value of Gibbs free energy (Supplementary Data\u00a07). We identified the top 30 drugs that might target MEOX2 or SRGN and verified them individually according to the high to low scores (Fig.\u00a06b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a012a, b). Targeted inhibition of these drugs on MEOX2 and SRGN was confirmed through a series of in vitro experiments. First, as mentioned previously, the CL and MES GSCs showed different reactivity to MEOX2 and SRGN inhibition. We tested the anti-tumoral efficacy of candidate drugs in CL and MES GSCs. Second, to further verify the targeted inhibition effect of these drugs on MEOX2 and SRGN, we detected the changes in downstream targets of MEOX2 and SRGN after drug treatment. Third, we confirmed the binding of these drugs to MEOX2 and SRGN proteins through an affinity experiment. We used bio-layer interferometry (BLI) to detect the binding of candidate drugs with MEOX2 or SRGN.\nAmong the top 30 MEOX2-targeting candidates, nilotinib and dihydroergocristine (DHEC) were the most effective drugs against CL GSCs. Among the top 30 SRGN-targeting candidates, MES GSCs displayed preferential sensitivity to paliperidone and risperidone (Fig.\u00a06c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a012c, g). After treatment with nilotinib or DHEC, the expression of MEOX2 downstream targets was significantly decreased in CL GSCs (Fig.\u00a06d and Supplementary Fig.\u00a013a). The downstream targets of SRGN were substantially reduced after treatment with paliperidone or risperidone in MES GSCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a013b, c). Protein levels of NFKB1 decreased after treatment with paliperidone or risperidone in MES GSCs (Fig.\u00a06e and Supplementary Fig.\u00a013d). The effects of these drugs on these downstream targets have been documented in several studies. Specifically, nilotinib was shown to decrease NOTCH1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. DHEC is a part of the ergoloid mixture products that directly inhibit \u03b3-secretase. Additionally, risperidone and paliperidone were demonstrated to exert their anti-inflammatory effects through inhibition of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. In CL and MES GSCs, the mRNA and protein levels of SOX2 and ID1 decreased after nilotinib/DHEC and paliperidone/risperidone treatment, respectively (Supplementary Fig.\u00a013e\u2013h). Nilotinib and DHEC treatment increased macrophage phagocytosis of CL GSCs. Paliperidone and risperidone treatment increased macrophage phagocytosis of MES GSCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a013i\u2013l). Finally, based on Kd values, these four drugs were inferred to interact directly with MEOX2 or SRGN and the binding of drugs to truncated proteins was weak (Fig.\u00a06f\u2013j). To determine the combinatorial efficacy, we interrogated the effects of a range of concentrations of each drug against two CL and MES GSCs. Synergy analysis of four drugs showed that the combination of nilotinib and paliperidone had the best synergetic effect (Supplementary Fig.\u00a014d\u2013g).\nGSCs WL1 were derived in our laboratory from a 55-year-old male patient with recurrent GBM. We performed scRNA-seq on WL1 to determine its cellular states distribution. The results showed that WL1 contained cells of all four cellular states. The proportions of four cellular states cells in WL1 were as follows: NPC-like (33.44%), OPC-like (13.17%), AC-like (14.83%), MES-like (38.56%) (Fig.\u00a07a). GSCs WL1 were functionally validated by in vivo serial transplantation assays (Fig.\u00a07b\u2013h). To isolate cells of CL/AC-like and MES/MES-like features, we isolated EGFR-high (CL/AC-like cell-surface marker) and CD44-high (MES/MES-like cell-surface marker) cells from WL1. Both qPCR and Western blot results showed that MEOX2 was enriched in EGFR\u2009+\u2009WL1 GSCs (representing AC-like cellular states), while SRGN displayed high expression in CD44\u2009+\u2009WL1 GSCs (representing MES-like cellular states) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a014a\u2013c). We then implanted these GSCs (1:1) orthotopically into immunocompromised mice to establish the model (Fig.\u00a07i). Next, we examined the therapeutic effects of drugs on this model. Bioluminescence imaging confirmed that combined therapy was more effective than monotherapy or vehicle control. These in vivo results translated into superior survival with combined treatment (Fig.\u00a07j\u2013m). The therapeutic effects of drugs on mice bearing intracranial tumors derived from a mixture of CL and MES GSCs showed the same results (Supplementary Fig.\u00a014h\u2013l). These results indicated that combined targeting of CL and MES GSCs with FDA-approved agents is an effective treatment strategy for heterogeneous GBM. Taken together, our study identified key drivers and downstream signaling pathways that govern CL and MES GSCs states. We provided clinically actionable drug candidates that serve as an avenue for combination therapies against a lethal and heterogeneous cancer (Supplementary Fig.\u00a015).",
        "DISCUSS": "Discussion\nHigh intratumoral heterogeneity is one of the hallmarks of GBM. From the therapeutic perspective, this heterogeneity is a major clinical obstacle in designing effective treatment strategies for GBM patients. Clinically relevant GBM subtypes have been defined based on the presence of IDH1/2 gene mutations. Bulk and single-cell transcriptional profiling identified dynamic cellular states influenced by underlying somatic alterations and interactions with the tumor microenvironment. Reversibly transition of tumor cells could occur between different cellular states in response to genetic, microenvironmental and therapeutic stimuli. This cellular plasticity complicates the study of GBM heterogeneity.\nGSCs are thought to contribute to intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity, although the extent of their role and the mechanisms involved remain areas of investigation. Single-cell sequencing and lineage tracking methods confirmed the existence of stem-like cancer cells in GBM, supported their importance in maintaining cell hierarchy, and further strengthened the concept of cell plasticity. Although various markers can be enriched for GSCs, the distinct molecular mechanisms of GSCs in these cancer subtypes have not been explored thoroughly. In this study, we found that high CL and MES GSCs proportion within tumors was associated with poor prognosis of GBM patients. Through integrative analysis of gene expression programs underlying GSCs, we surveyed scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq datasets. MEOX2 and SRGN were identified as characteristic targets of CL and MES GSCs, respectively, with targeted therapeutic utility.\nMEOX2 belongs to the homeobox genes family of transcription factors. These transcription factors can promote cell growth, migration, angiogenesis, and maintain cell quiescence. Recent studies have revealed that MEOX2 acts as a critical transcriptonal regulator in GBM progression. MEOX2 promotes GBM progression by driving epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cytoskeletal dynamics, and focal adhesion formation, thereby enhancing tumor cell invasion and proliferation, both of which are critical for tumor cells survival and growth. Our data extends these findings by showing that MEOX2 is enriched in CL GSCs. MEOX2-NOTCH axis plays an important role in CL GSCs\u2019 self-renewal and stemness maintenance. SRGN is a low molecular weight glycoprotein distributed in the cytoplasm. SRGN plays an essential role in the storage and secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and proteases and has been reported to participate in many physiological and pathological processes. Recent studies highlighted SRGN\u2019s importane in GBM biology. SRGN facilitates glioblastoma invasion, metastasis, and immune evasion by enhancing inflammatory and proteolytic signaling cascades. Our results demonstrated that SRGN was a representative target of MES GSCs. SRGN characteristically regulated the proliferation and stemness of MES GSCs. SRGN regulated the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by maintaining NFKB1 protein stability.\nPrior studies have highlighted the heterogeneous distribution of GSCs across distinct niches, necessitating subtype-specific therapeutic strategies tailored to their microenvironment context. While cellular heterogeneity exists among GSCs states, their contributions to tumor progression are not equivalent. Our analysis revealed that both CL and MES GSCs concentrate in regions with high immune cell presence, particularly marked by macrophage infiltration. As key innate immune sentinels, macrophages exhibit dual regulator roles mediated by competing pro-phagocytic ligands and immunosuppressive checkpoint molecules that modulate tumor cell clearance. Dominant engagement of inhibitory receptors in these niches suppresses macrophage phagocytic activation, creating immune-evasive microdomains. The best-studied inhibitory receptor on macrophages is SIRP\u03b1, which recognizes as ligand the cell surface molecule CD47, often overexpressed on tumor cells. Reprogramming tumor-promoting macrophages into tumor-suppressive macrophages can effectively inhibit GBM growth. It was shown that inhibition of the CD47-SIRP\u03b1 (signal regulatory protein \u03b1) axis in TAMs inhibited brain tumor growth in animal models. Therefore, the methods related to enhancing the phagocytic effect of macrophages on GSCs also have high research significance. We found high expression of anti-phagocytosis checkpoint in CL and MES GSCs. MEOX2 and SRGN are involved in regulating anti-phagocytosis checkpoint expression in CL and MES GSCs, respectively. Targeting MEOX2 and SRGN enhanced macrophage phagocytosis of CL and MES GSCs.\nDue to the limited benefit of a single targeted drug in improving patient survival, studying treatment strategies that combine different targeted drugs is becoming a viable strategy. Combining drugs could overcome some of the problems associated with GBM treatment. For example, a phase II clinical trial combined using bevacizumab and the topoisomerase inhibitor irinotecan prolonged median overall survival times to 9.2 months compared to 8.7 months with bevacizumab alone in recurrent GBM. Although some research progress has been made using traditional methods such as combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy, there is still much room for improvement given the improved understanding of the molecular underpinning of GBM. MEOX2 and SRGN are targets representing CL and MES subtype properties in GSCs, respectively. Using virtual molecular screening combined with experimental validation, we identified drugs that target MEOX2 and SRGN. These FDA-approved drugs can cross the blood-brain barrier. For drug targeting MEOX2, nilotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for the chronic phase treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). For drug targeting SRGN, paliperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) medication used to treat several mental health conditions, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We first reported the efficacy of targeting MEOX2 with nilotinib and SRGN with paliperidone. Our findings further extend the indications for these agents and provide a rationale for conducting clinical trials combining targeted CL and MES GSCs.\nThe proportion of GSCs in each cellular state varies among patients. Each cellular state defines the types of stress response it can mount, which may affect the clinical response of targeted therapy. Directing therapeutics against the cellular form will be a priori addressed for each resistant mechanism mediated by that state. Our study offers a practical therapeutic strategy to co-opt state selective lethality in a preclinical model. Our investigation discovered that the representative targets MEOX2 and SRGN in CL and MES GSCs. We provided a deep understanding of the distinct regulatory mechanisms of CL and MES GSCs. Our data demonstrated the efficacy of rationally designed combinatorial targeting approaches. Using genetic and pharmacologic techniques, we found that combination therapy with FDA-approved agents targeting both CL and MES GSCs resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth in our experimental models. Combinatorial targeting based on the improved understanding of intratumoral heterogeneity at the single-cell level will inform future clinical trial design in GBM.",

        "METHODS": "Methods\nEthics statement\nThe study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and approved by Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (2021-SR-076), Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University (KYSQ2019-200-01), and Case Western Reserve University (090401). We have obtained informed consent from all participants for publishing their individual-level data as presented in Supplementary Data\u00a02 and 5.\nHuman glioblastoma samples\nThe scRNA-seq dataset 1 were derived from 7 samples. The 7 GBM specimens were obtained from the Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. All patient studies were conducted in accordance with the recognized ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (2021-SR-076).\nFor GBM specimens in scRNA-seq dataset 2, 15 patients (17 samples) with GBM were enrolled and pathologically diagnosed with GBM at Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University. All patients provided written informed consent for sample collection and data analyses. The Research and Ethical Committee approved this study of Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University (KYSQ2019-200-01). Fresh tumor samples were surgical resected from the above patients.\nThe available clinical characteristics of these patients are summarized in Supplementary Data\u00a02. Sex and gender information was collected for all participants. However, sex and gender were not included as variables in the primary analysis. This study focused on characterizing the molecular mechanisms specific to distinct GSCs subtypes within individual GBM patients, where these intrinsic cellular properties and regulatory mechanisms have not been shown to be significantly influenced by sex and gender in previous studies.\nPatient-derived and cell-line models\nGlioblastoma tissues of GSCs were obtained from excess surgical resection samples from patients who underwent treatment at Case Western Reserve University and the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University after review by neuropathology with appropriate consent and in accordance with an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol (090401 and 2021-SR-076). All samples were examined by neuropathologists. Patient-derived xenografts were propagated as a renewable source of GSCs, to minimize in vitro artifacts from cell culture. All GSCs were derived as reported previously. Authentication of tumor models was performed with STR analysis and all GSCs were regularly tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. The available GSCs information are summarized in Supplementary Data\u00a05.\nThe nonmalignant neural stem cell models ENSA and hNP1 were used in this study. ENSA (ENStem-A) is a human embryonic stem\u2013derived neural progenitor cell obtained from Millipore Sigma (Cat# SCC003). hNP1 (STEMEZ hNP1) is a human neural progenitor cell obtained from Neuromics (Cat# HN60001). 293\u2009T cells obtained from ATCC (Cat# CRL-3216) were used to generate lentiviral particles. U937 cells obtained from ATCC(Cat# CRL-1593.2) were used to induced M1 macrophages. All these cells were authenticated by the supplier using STR analysis and were regularly tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.\nIn vivo tumorigenesis and animal experiments\nAll animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC-2006033) at Nanjing Medical University in accordance with NIH and institutional guidelines. Both male and female mice were used in studies. BALB/c-Nude mice (Strain NO. D000521) and NCG mice (Strain NO. T001475) at 4 to 6 weeks of age were purchased from GemPharmatech (Nanjing, China). Mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) facility under controlled conditions, including a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle, an ambient temperature of 22\u201324\u2009\u00b0C, and relative humidity maintained at 40\u201360%. Pathogen-free environments were provided at the Animal Core Facility of Nanjing Medical University. Welfare monitoring, including supervision of housing conditions and animal status, was conducted daily by a veterinarian. Mice were monitored until neurologic signs were observed, at which point they were euthanised. Mice were euthanized using CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation to ensure death. All mice were randomly assigned to appropriate treatment groups. The investigators were blinded to the group allocation and study outcome assessments of all mice. The maximal tumor burden was strictly limited to 1.2\u2009cm in diameter for mice, with a total tumor weight not exceeding 10% of the mice body weight. No animals exceeded these limits during the study. To monitor tumor growth in living animals, all GSCs used for the animal study were transduced with firefly luciferase through lentiviral infection.\nFor testing the in vivo inhibition effect of MEOX2 and SRGN knockdown. Inducible shMEOX2/shSRGN constructs (pTRIPZ) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. GSCs stably expressing firefly luciferase were infected with lentivirus carrying inducible pTRIPZ-shMEOX2 or pTRIPZ-shSRGN. 3028 (CL) or 2907 (MES) GSCs of shCONT, shMEOX2, or shSRGN cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104) were then intracranially injected into the right frontal lobe at a depth of 3\u2009mm. After GSCs implantation, the mice were observed daily and euthanized when they presented neurologic signs or became moribund. When the luciferase signals from tumor cells were detectable, mice were treated with the vehicle control or doxycycline (2\u2009mg/ml in drinking water) to induce the expression of shMEOX2/shSRGN in xenografts. The size of the orthotopic tumor was monitored by the bioluminescence channel of the IVIS Spectrum.\nFor the WL1 xenograft model, we isolated EGFR-high (CL/AC-like cell-surface marker) and CD44-high (MES/MES-like cell-surface marker) cells from WL1. We then implanted these GSCs (1:1) orthotopically into immunocompromised mice to establish the model. For the subtype-mixed glioblastoma model. 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 3028 (CL) and 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 2907 (MES) GSCs were implanted into the right frontal lobe of mice. For the signaling pathway inhibitors, the concentrations in plasma and brain were determined by HPLC. When the luciferase signals from tumor cells were detectable, the drugs, water containing 2\u2009mg/ml doxycycline or control water were administered. RG-4733 was administered orally by gavage, and PDTC was administered intraperitoneally. For the administration of four target inhibitors (Nilotinib, DHEC, Paliperidone, and Risperidone), after the establishment of the tumor-bearing mouse model, Nilotinib was administered orally by gavage, and the other three drugs were administered intraperitoneally. Finally, the size of the orthotopic tumor was monitored by the bioluminescence channel of the IVIS Spectrum.\nCulture of glioblastoma stem cells and other cell models\nGSCs were cultured as neurospheres in the neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% B27 supplement (Life Technologies), 1% L-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, 20\u2009ng/mL bFGF, and EGF (R&D Systems). GSCs were maintained and cultured as spheres for all experiments except immunofluorescence analyses, where cells were cultured as monolayers to facilitate imaging.\nNSCs were cultured in neurobasal media supplemented with 2% B27, 20\u2009ng/mL EGF, and bFGF. 293\u2009T cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). U937 cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium containing 10% FBS.\nInduction of glioblastoma stem cells to differentiated glioblastoma cells\nFor differentiation of GSCs to DGCs, fully grown neurospheres were collected and plated on normal cell culture dishes in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and withdrawal of growth factors for 28 days.\nSingle-cell library preparation and sequencing\nCells from the samples in the scRNA-seq dataset collected from The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University were counted using a Countess instrument (ThermoFisher) and diluted to 700 to 1200 cells/\u03bcL. Cells were processed according to the Chromium single-cell RNA 3\u2032 kit protocol (10X Genomics V2.0 chemistry) to capture 10,000 cells/chip positions. All the remaining procedures, including library construction, were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Libraries were quantified using an Agilent high-sensitivity DNA chip on a Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent). Single-cell libraries were then sequenced on an Illumina HiSeqXTen instrument (PE150).\nThe cells collected from Beijing Tiantan Hospital were loaded into Chromium microfluidic chips with 3\u2032 (10X Genomics V2.0) chemistry and barcoded with a 10X Chromium Controller (10X Genomics). RNA from the barcoded cells was subsequently reverse-transcribed, and sequencing libraries were constructed with a Chromium single-cell RNA 3\u2032 v2 reagent kit (10X Genomics). The libraries were sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Illumina).\nThe single-cell sequencing data were analyzed using Cell Ranger (version 6.1.2, 10X Genomics) with default parameters. The data quality was assessed using the Seurat package (version 4.3.0).\nPlasmids and lentiviral transduction\nLentiviral constructs expressing non-overlapping shRNAs directed against human MEOX2 (TRCN0000427218 and TRCN0000433531), human SRGN (TRCN0000007985 and TRCN0000007987), human NOTCH1 (TRCN0000003359 and TRCN0000350330), human NFKB1 (TRCN0000006517 and TRCN0000006520) or a non-targeting control shRNA (SHC002) with no targets in the human genome were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. For CRISPR/Cas9 experiments, sgRNAs were cloned into the lentiCRISPR v2 plasmid (Addgene, Cat# 52961). All shRNAs and sgRNAs sequences are listed in Supplementary Data\u00a08. Full-length human MEOX2, SRGN, NOTCH1, and NFKB1 in the pCMV6 vector were purchased from Origene and cloned into the BamHI and Xhol restriction sites of the pcDNA 3.1 vector (Invitrogen) for the overexpression assay. 293\u2009T cells (ATCC, Cat# CRL-3216) were used to generate lentiviral particles by co-transfecting the packaging vectors psPAX2 and pMD2.G using a standard calcium phosphate transfection method in neurobasal complete medium.\nProliferation and neurosphere formation assays\nCell proliferation experiments were conducted by plating cells of interest at a density of 2000 cells/well in 96-well plates with six replicates. CellTiter-Glo (Promega, Cat# G7571) was used to measure cell viability on days 1, 3, 5, and 7. All data were normalized to day 1 and presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. For the drug response test, 2000 cells were seeded under Notch signaling inhibitors (DAPT, RG-4733, Semagacestat), NF-\u03baB signaling inhibitors (BAY11-7082, JSH-23, PDTC), drugs potential targeting MEOX2 (Nilotinib, DHEC, Imatinib, Abiraterone, Dutasteride, Lurasidone, etc.), and drugs potential targeting SRGN (Paliperidone, Risperidone, Conivaptan, Lumacaftor, Adapalene, Capmatinib, etc.) treatment. The plates were transferred to an incubator (37\u2009\u00b0C, 5% CO2) for 48\u2009h. IC50 values of inhibitors and drugs were calculated with GraphPad Prism software.\nNeurosphere formation was measured by in vitro limiting dilution. Briefly, decreasing numbers of cells per well (50, 20, 10, 5, and 1) were plated into 96-well plates. The presence and number of neurospheres in each well were recorded 14 days after plating. Extreme limiting dilution analysis was performed using software available at http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda. All proliferation and neurosphere experiments were performed with at least six replicates.\nRNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR\nTotal cellular RNA from cells was isolated by Trizol reagent (Takara, Cat# 9109). The PrimeScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara, Cat# RR036A) was used for reverse transcription into cDNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus cycler using SYBR-Green PCR Master Mix (ThermoFisher, Cat# A25742). All the primers used for qRT-PCR are listed in Supplementary Data\u00a08.\nWestern blotting\nFor western blot analysis, cells and tissues were collected and lysed in RIPA buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.1% SDS and supplemented with protease inhibitors), then incubated on ice for 30\u2009min. Lysates were centrifuged at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min at 12,000\u2009rpm, and supernatants were collected. Supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 2\u2009h and then immunoblotted with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C followed by the HRP-conjugated antibody at room temperature for 2\u2009h. The blots were developed by SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (ThermoFisher, Cat# 34580). Antibodies used were as follows: anti-MEOX2 (Cat# DF3192, Affinity, 1:500), anti-SRGN (Cat#: PA5-51452, Invitrogen, 1:250), anti-SOX2 (Cat#: AF5140, Affinity, 1:500), anti-ID1 (Cat# DF2932, Affinity, 1:1000), anti-NFKB1 (Cat# 13586, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), His-Tag antibody (Cat#: 12698, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), Flag-Tag antibody (Cat# 14793, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), HA-Tag antibody (Cat# 3724, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), anti-beta Tubulin (Cat# AM1031a, Abcepta, 1:1000), anti-NOTCH1 (Cat# 3608, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000).\nImmunofluorescence\nImmunofluorescence experiments were performed using GBM surgical specimens or GSCs. Tumor samples from GBM patient surgical specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u2009\u00b0C, followed by cryoprotection with 30% sucrose in PBS at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Paraffin section were stained with primary antibodies anti-SOX2 (R&D, AF2018, 1:100), anti-CD45 (abcam, ab40763, 1:100), anti-CD44 (Cat# 3570, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:200), anti-EGFR (Cat# 4267, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:50), anti-MEOX2 (Affinity, DF3152, 1:100) and anti-SRGN (Santa Cruz, sc-374657, 1:50). For GSCs, cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for 30\u2009min and washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.45% Triton X-100 for 10\u2009min, and blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at room temperature for 2\u2009h. Cells were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies anti-SRGN (Santa Cruz, Cat# sc-374657, 1:50), and anti-NFKB1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat# 13586, 1:200) at 4\u2009\u00b0C overnight. The next day, the cells were washed 3 times with blocking buffer and incubated with secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat #A4412 and Cat# A8890, 1:500). Images were captured with a Zeiss LSM700 microscope (Carl Zeiss) and processed using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, RRID:SCR_003070).\nFor Fig.\u00a01i,\u00a0j, Supplementary Fig.\u00a01f, Supplementary Fig.\u00a01g, Supplementary Fig.\u00a03d, and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03e, immunofluorescence images in each group were taken from the same section. The sections for Fig.\u00a01i, j, Supplementary Fig.\u00a01f and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01g, and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03d and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03e were obtained from consecutive sections of the same sample.\nImmunoprecipitation\nGSCs transfected with the indicated constructs were collected and lysed in IP buffer (20\u2009mM Tris-HCl, 150\u2009mM NaCl 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1\u2009mM DTT) containing PMSF and cocktail protease inhibitor at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009mins, and followed by centrifugation at 14,000\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The lysates were incubated with IP antibody overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The supernatants were immunoprecipitated by incubation with Protein A/G Plus Agarose (ThermoFisher, Cat# 20423) at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009h. Captured proteins were washed with IP buffer three times before immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analysis. Antibodies used were as follows: anti-SRGN (Cat# NBP1-80886, Novus, 1:100), anti-NFKB1 (Cat# 13586, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:100), Flag-Tag antibody (Cat# 14793, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:50).\nMass spectrometry\nThe identification of protein gel strips was to separate the sample proteins by gel electrophoresis, then obtain the protein gel strips at different positions on the film, and extract the peptides after enzymatic digestion. The peptides separated by liquid phase chromatography were ionized by a nanoESI source and then passed to a tandem mass spectrometer Q-Exactive HF X (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) for DDA (Data Dependent Acquisition) mode detection. The protein identification uses experimental MS/MS data and aligns them with theoretical MS/MS data from the Uniprot protein database to obtain results. The main parameters were set: ion source voltage was set to 1.9\u2009kV, MS1 scanning range was 350\u20131500\u2009m/z; resolution was set to 60,000; MS2 starting m/z was fixed at 100; resolution was 15,000. The ion screening conditions for MS2 fragmentation: charge 2+ to 6\u2009+\u2009, and the top 30 parent ions with the peak intensity exceeding 10,000. The ion fragmentation mode was HCD, and the fragment ions were detected in Orbitrap. The dynamic exclusion time was set to 30\u2009s. The AGC was set to: MS1 3E6, MS2 1E5.\nThe whole process starts from converting raw MS data into a peak list and then searching matches in the UniProt protein database. Mascot (version 2.3.02) was used for protein identification. The mgf file was used as the original file. The parameters of Mascot are as follows: Enzyme: Trypsin. Peptide mass tolerance: 20\u2009ppm. Fragment mass tolerance:0.05\u2009Da. Fixed modifications: Carbamidomethyl (C). Variable modifications: Oxidation (M), Gln->pyro-Glu (N-term Q), Deamidated (NQ). Max missed cleavages: 1; Instrument type: ESI-FTICR. The output was then filtered by FDR 1% at spectral level (PSM-level FDR\u2009\u2264\u20090.01) to obtain a significant identified spectrum and peptide list. Finally, from the final protein identification list, analyses such as GO analysis (DAVID 6.8) were performed.\nFlow cytometry and in vitro flow-based phagocytosis assay\nU937-derived M1 macrophages were generated as macrophage model. Briefly, U937 cells were primed with PMA (Sigma, 5\u2009nM) for 48\u2009h to become unpolarized macrophages. To establish the M1 macrophages, the unpolarized macrophages were stimulated with 20\u2009ng/ml of IFN-\u03b3 (Peprotech) and 100\u2009ng/ml of LPS (Sigma) for an additional 48\u2009h.\nCL GSCs (3028) virally expressed Zsgreen and MES GSCs (2907) virally expressed mCherry. GSCs were transduced with shRNAs or pre-treated with drugs (two days). For all flow-based in vitro phagocytosis assays, GSCs (CL\u2009+\u2009MES, 1:1) and macrophages were co-cultured at a ratio of 2:1 in ultra-low-attachment 96-well U-bottom plates (Corning) in serum-free RPMI (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Co-cultured 3028-Zsgreen and 2907-mCherry were added to each well and co-incubated with the macrophages for 2\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. After co-culture, reactions were stained with anti-CD45 (BD Biosciences, Cat# 564879, 5\u2009\u03bcl per test) to identify macrophages. Phagocytosis was evaluated as a sum of the Zsgreen+ or mCherry+ macrophages, expressed as a percentage of the total macrophages, as analyzed using FlowJo.\nTo isolate GSCs with distinct cellular states, cells were labeled with anti-CD44 (Cat# 559942, BD Biosciences, 20\u2009\u00b5l per test) for MES-like, anti-EGFR (Cat# 352903, Biolegend, 5\u2009\u00b5l per test) for AC-like, anti-CD24 (Cat# 311121, Biolegend, 5\u2009\u00b5l per test) for NPC-like, and anti-PDGFRA (Cat# 323507, Biolegend, 5\u2009\u00b5l per test) for OPC-like states.\nHigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)\nFor six inhibitors, RG-4733 and DAPT were administered orally by gavage, and Semagacestat, BAY11-7082, JSH-23, and PDTC were administered intraperitoneally. Blood samples were collected from the faces of mice before and 0.5\u2009h after drug administration. Serum was collected after 3000\u2009g centrifugation for 15\u2009min. 50\u2009\u03bcl serum was added to 150\u2009\u03bcl methanol and vortex mixed for 10\u2009min. The supernatant was centrifuged by 10,000\u2009g for 5\u2009min. The corresponding mouse brain tissue was taken and weighed. After adding methanol with the same weight as the brain tissue, the Polytron HG-300 homogenizer was used to perform the homogenization. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000\u2009g for 10\u2009min, 50\u2009\u03bcl supernatant was taken, 150\u2009\u03bcl methanol was added and the above operation was repeated. After measuring the standard curve for each drug according to the conditions recommended by the reagent manufacturer, the samples were measured and analyzed by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (SHIMADZU).\nSynergy assays\nCells were seeded in 96-well plates (2000 cells/well) and treated with the interval of concentration of drugs indicated for 48\u2009h. Then, cell viability was assessed with CellTiter-Glo (Promega, Cat# G7571) assay and normalized to the untreated wells. Synergy was calculated using the HAS method using the SynergyFinder web application (https://synergyfinder.fimm.fi).\nCalculation of achievable Notch and NF-\u03baB pathway inhibitors concentrations\nOur studies used 200\u2009mg/kg RG-4733 (Notch signaling inhibitor) after oral administration for 0.5\u2009h, leading to a calculated brain concentration of 84.28\u2009\u00b1\u200911.42\u2009\u03bcM. We determined the concentration of the PDTC (NF-\u03baB signaling inhibitor) after intraperitoneal injection of 100\u2009mg/kg for 0.5\u2009h. Using the same approach that we used for the RG-4733 concentration calculations, we estimated the brain concentration range of the PDTC as 88.92\u2009\u00b1\u20093.04\u2009\u03bcM. For animal experiments, we used 75\u2009mg/kg RG-4733 and 50\u2009mg/kg PDTC for each mouse. According to calculation, in vivo drug ranges for each agent achieved concentrations consistent with those we detected as having combinational benefit in IC50 concentrations from synergy assays.\nBio-Layer Interferometry (BLI)\nNi-NTA biosensors were loaded with His-tag recombinant human SRGN protein (Sino Biological Inc., Cat# LC15AU2001) and MEOX2 protein (Origene, Cat# AR51018PU-N) and then incubated with three compounds (Conivaptan, Cat# T6453; Risperidone, Cat# T0351; Paliperidone, Cat# T0076; Jervine, Cat# T3363; Targetmol) to generate an association curve (ForteBio Octet). The 60\u2009s association phase was subsequently followed by a 90\u2009s dissociation step to obtain the Kd value by the fitting curve.\nSingle-cell sequencing data processing and analysis\nSingle-cell sequencing data were processed to filter out low-quality reads with the following criteria: (1) \u2018N\u2019 bases accounting for \u226510% of the read length; (2) bases with quality <5 accounting for \u226550% of the read length; and (3) the reads contain adaptor sequence. The remaining reads were processed using the 10X cellranger pipeline (version 6.1.2) against the hg38 human reference genome to obtain the gene expression matrix. Gene-barcode count matrices were analyzed with the Seurat R package (version 4.3.0). Cells with <200 genes detected and >10% mitochondrial gene mapped reads were filtered from downstream analyses. Further, we removed the potential doublets that occurred in the encapsulation step and/or as occasional pairs of cells that were not dissociated in sample preparation using the DoubletFinder package of the R.\nAfter quality control, we normalized data by NormalizeData function in Seurat. The most variable 2000 genes were determined using the FindVariableGenes function with default parameters. We used the ScaleData function in Seurat to regress out UMI count and percentage of mitochondrial genes. PCA was performed using the RunPCA with these 2000 genes in Seurat.\nWe performed the \u2018RunHarmony\u2019 Harmony function to remove the effect of confounding factors in different samples. Dimensionality reduction was then performed using Harmony-adjusted space and UMAP plots were generated by the RunUMAP Seurat function. To identify cell clusters, we performed the FindNeighbors and FindClusters function in Seurat with the FindClusters parameter \u201cresolution = 1\u201d.\nTo identify differentially expressed genes for each cell cluster, we used the FindMarkers function with default parameters in Seurat to evaluate the significance of each gene. These clusters were then labeled with particular cell states based on marker gene expression.\nTumor cells identification and GSC-like tumor cells prediction\nCNAs were estimated by sorting the analyzed genes by their chromosomal location and applying a moving average to the relative expression values, with a sliding window of 100 genes within each chromosome. Cells classified to each of the non-malignant cell types were used to define a baseline of normal karyotype. CNA analysis were performed using inferCNV. Cells were then classified as malignant by CNA analysis if they had high CNA signal. We then combined the CNA classification with the UMAP-based classifications, such that the final list of malignant cells included those which were classified as malignant by CNA, were part of the malignant UMAP cluster, and were not classified to any of the non-malignant cell types based on the marker gene-sets. We defined GSC-like tumor cells within malignant cells as any cells expressing CD133, CD15, or OCT4, in conjunction with SOX2.\nSpatial transcriptomics analysis\nThe GBM spatial transcriptomic data used in this study are publicly available in the Datadryad database [10.5061/dryad.h70rxwdmj]. We analyzed 16 IDH-WT GBMs using SPATA2. For spatial expression plots, we used scaled gene expression values (to plot single genes) or enrichment scores of a defined geneset. The x-axis and y-axis coordinates are given by the input file based on the localization to the H&E staining. The data are illustrated as surface plots (plotly package R-software).\nPan-cancer data collection and analysis\nWe analyzed MEOX2 and SRGN expression in all tumor types in TCGA. Uniformly processed TCGA RNA-seq (FPKM) data were obtained from the UCSC Xena server (https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/). Differential expression analysis was performed using R package limma.\nAssignment of cells to metaprograms\nFor scRNA-seq and stRNA-seq data, cells were first annotated in the datasets (tumor cells, myeloid cells, oligodendrocytes, lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts). Tumor cells were assigned to the meta-module between the six meta-modules (MES1-like, MES2-like, NPC1-like, NPC2-like, AC-like, OPC-like) as previously described. For most analyses, we collapsed the MES1 and MES2 groups of cells into one group of MES-like cells, and similarly, the NPC1 and NPC2 cells into one group of NPC-like cells. All signatures were subjected to a construction model using ssGSEA. To identify the exact molecular signatures in each cell analyzed by scRNA-seq, the signature score calculated by ssGSEA was evaluated using the permutation analysis. One signature whose permutation p-value was smallest was taken as the main feature for the indicated cells.\nFor bulk RNA-seq data, the intrinsic subtypes (PN, CL, MES) of GSCs can be classified using ssGSEA on a 3\u2009\u00d7\u200950 gene subset of the 7425 genes originally used for defining the subtypes with non-negative matrix factorization (NMF).\nRNA-seq and data analysis\nDGCs were induced by their corresponding GSCs. For MEOX2 and SRGN knockout RNA-seq in CL GSC (3028) and MES GSC (2907), respectively. Patient-derived GSCs (3028 and 2907) were transduced with either control or two independent sgRNAs for MEOX2 (sgMEOX2-1 and sgMEOX2-2) or SRGN (sgSRGN-1 and sgSRGN-2), and successfully transduced cells were selected by puromycin for 3 days. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Takara, Cat# 9109) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA sequencing was performed using MGI2000 platforms. FASTQ sequencing reads were trimmed using Trim Galore (https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore), and transcript quantification was conducted using Salmon with the quasi-mapping mode. Salmon \u201cquant\u201d files were converted using Tximport, and differential expression analysis was performed using the R package limma. GSEA was performed by selecting differentially expressed genes, generating a pre-ranked list, and analyzing by R package clusterProfilter.\nChromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and data analysis\n4\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells per condition were collected, and ChIP assay was performed using the SimpleChIP Plus Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat# 9005) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Briefly, 10\u2009\u00b5l MEOX2 antibody (Atlas, Cat# HPA053793, 1:50) or non-specific IgG was used for the immunoprecipitation of the DNA-protein immunocomplexes. Crosslinking was reversed by heating for 6\u2009h at 65\u2009\u00b0C, followed by digestion with proteinase K. In-depth whole-genome DNA sequencing was performed by BGI (Shenzhen, China). The data generated by Illumina sequencing passed quality control was compared with the human reference genome (hg38) sequence using Bowtie2, and finally peak detection and scanning were performed using MACS2. Input was used as a control for peak calling. ChIPseeker was used to annotate the peaks. Peaks and alignments were visualized using IGV.\nDeconvolution analysis\nCellular proportions and cell state-specific gene expression matrices were inferred from bulk RNA-seq gene expression matrices using CIBERSORTx. Reference scRNA-seq signature matrices were created from our internal 10x-derived scRNA-seq dataset using the \u2018Create Signature Matrix\u2019 module on the CIBERSORTx webserver (https://cibersortx.stanford.edu/) with default parameters and quantile normalization disabled. The CIBERSORTx webserver currently recommends users input no more than 5000 different single-cell profiles when creating their signature matrix. To meet this recommendation, our internal scRNA-seq dataset was randomly down sampled to 5000 cells using the \u2018sample\u2019 command in R with the seed set to 123. The cells not included in signature matrix formation were then set aside for validation analyses. For all runs, the bulk RNAseq dataset was input as the \u2018mixture\u2019 file and the respective signature matrix was input as the \u2018sigmatrix\u2019 file. For runs using our 10x-derived internal scRNAseq signatures, batch correction was done in \u2018S-mode\u2019 by setting the \u2018rmbatchSmode\u2019 parameter to TRUE.\nVirtual screening\nThe Alphafold 2 database model was applied to predict the potential binding region of the target protein (Binding pocket of SRGN: 28-60 amino acids; DNA binding region of MEOX2: 187-246 amino acids), then proteins were docked with 2513 FDA-approved drugs via virtual screening. The score was ranked according to the value of Gibbs free energy (Supplementary Data\u00a07).\nStatistics and reproducibility\nAll data are shown as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism with Student\u2019s t-test or ANOVA. For Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves, statistical differences between groups were determined by log-rank test. For all Fig. presented in a box-and-whisker format, the center line represents the median and the lower and upper limits of the box represent the 25th and 75th percentiles. The maximum and minimum are connected to the center box through the vertical lines. Blinding and randomization were performed in all experiments. This study complies with randomization in grouping age-matched mice into different experimental arms. The investigator was blinded to the group allocation during the experiment and/or when assessing the outcome. Sex and gender were not considered in the study design and analysis as it was not relevant to the research question being addressed.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.",

        "TITLE": "Low intensity pulsed ultrasound alleviates synovial fibrosis in osteoarthritis via the PI3K/AKT pathway",
        "ABSTRACT": "Previous studies have reported that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) can alleviate cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis (OA). However, the functions and mechanisms of LIPUS in synovial fibrosis with OA require further study. To investigate the role of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in synovial fibrosis and in LIPUS treatment in synovial fibrosis, a TGF-\u03b2\u00a0stimulated rat FLS cell model and a rat OA animal model based on anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) and partial medial meniscectomy (MMx) were used. The results revealed that LIPUS delayed the progression of OA. Masson staining revealed that LIPUS reduced the collagen deposition of synovial tissue in OA rats. Correspondingly, immunofluorescence demonstrated that LIPUS significantly downregulated the expression of \u03b1-SMA, Col1a1 and Col3a1 in OA rats. Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 stimulation upregulated fibrosis markers at the mRNA and protein levels in FLS, as well as increased phosphorylation-dependent activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. 740Y-P was found to promote the fibrotic change of FLS induced by TGF-\u03b2, but LY294002 reduced its expression. However, LIPUS inhibits the fibrotic change and activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in FLS under stimulation of TGF-\u03b2. In conclusion, LIPUS alleviates synovial fibrosis by blocking the PI3K/AKT pathway.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-92413-x.",
        "INTRO": "Introduction\nOsteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic disease that can affect the knee joint. It manifests itself primarily as cartilage degeneration, synovitis, subchondral bone sclerosis, and osteophyte formation, of which synovitis is considered an important feature of OA development. Synovitis induces synovial fibrosis and results in synovial tissue hyperplasia and joint pain. Under pathological conditions of synovitis, synovial tissue secretes inflammatory factors, such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, following stimulation, which induce proliferation and fibrotic changes in the synovial fibroblasts, ultimately leading to synovial fibrosis. Synovial fibrosis promotes the secretion of additional inflammatory factors and collagen deposition, which further exacerbates joint pain and stiffness, impairs joint movement, and reduces the quality of patient survival. Consequently, the controlled synovial inflammation and fibrosis represent a significant avenue for the treatment of OA.\nA number of treatments are available for cartilage degeneration and synovitis of OA, including glucosamine sulfate, hyaluronic acid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and surgical treatments such as joint replacement. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis and treatment of synovial fibrosis in osteoarthritis remain incompletely understood. Compared to drugs and surgery, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has been widely used as safe and non-invasive physical therapy for the treatment of joint trauma, soft tissue injuries, and other diseases by regulating the inflammatory response associated with various signaling pathways. Some studies have shown that LIPUS is beneficial for the treatment of OA, when focused on cartilage degeneration and synovitis. Interestingly, LIPUS improves fibrosis in the myocardium and kidney; however, the reports involving LIPUS treatment of synovial fibrosis are limited.\nPrevious studies have indicated that targeting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway inhibits fibrosis of the oral mucosa, peritoneum, and liver. In addition, PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors, such as GSK2126458, HEC68498, and rapamycin, are being studied or have completed clinical trials for the treatment of liver fibrosis. It should be noted that inhibition of PI3K/AKT also reduced synovial inflammation and fibrosis caused by M1 polarization of synovial macrophages. The above results demonstrated that inhibition of PI3K/AKT pathway can relieve synovial inflammation and fibrosis. However, in OA, it is unclear whether LIPUS can inhibit synovial fibrosis by attenuating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.\nTherefore, we used a rat OA model established by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) combined with partial medial meniscus excision (MMx) and a TGF-\u03b2-induced rat fibroblast-like synovicytes(FLS) fibrosis model to investigate the effects of LIPUS on rat synovial fibrosis. We propose that LIPUS affects synovial fibrosis by regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.",
        "RESULTS": "Results\nLIPUS delays the progression of OA\nTo determine the role of LIPUS in OA, we performed histopathology to evaluate knee cartilage lesions in OA rats after LIPUS treatment. In particular, LIPUS treatment resulted in a significantly lower OA score than OA, characterized by more chondrocytes, less cartilage erosion, and loss of proteoglycans [Fig.\u00a01a\u2013b, Supplementary Fig.\u00a01]. We then examined the effects of LIPUS on cartilage metabolism, LIPUS treatment reversed the increase in MMP13 expression and the decrease in type 2 collagen a1 (Col2a1) levels at 4 weeks after ACLT\u2009+\u2009MMx surgery [Fig.\u00a01c\u2013f]. And compared to OA, low levels of synovial hyperplasia and less inflammatory cell infiltration were observed in the synovial tissue of OA rats treated with LIPUS, combined with lower synovitis scores at 4 weeks after surgery [Fig.\u00a01g\u2013h]. In addition, the results of the ELISA revealed that LIPUS inhibited the expression of inflammatory factors, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1, in serum collected from the abdominal aortas of rats with OA [Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a-d]. These findings suggested that LIPUS can improve articular cartilage lesions, relieve synovitis, and synovial hyperplasia, which can delay the progression of OA.\nLIPUS relieves synovial fibrosis in OA rats\nTo determine the effect of the LIPUS intervention on synovial fibrosis in rats. First, we measured the expression of the fibrotic proteins, LN, HA, and PIII-NP, in the serum of the abdominal aortas of rats by ELISA. The results indicated that the LIPUS intervention significantly decreased the levels of fibrotic proteins in the serum of OA rats [Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a\u2013c]. Regarding histomorphology, Masson staining revealed that collagen deposition in the synovial tissue of OA rats decreased after LIPUS treatment, thereby inhibiting synovial fibrosis [Fig.\u00a02a, b]. Synovitis, as one of the main pathological manifestations of osteoarthritis, is closely related to fibrosis. Therefore, we analyzed the correlation between synovitis scores and the percentage of synovial collagen volume fraction in rats with OA. The R values were 0.8158, indicating a positive correlation between the degree of synovitis and the fraction of synovial collagen volume [Fig.\u00a02c]. Subsequently, we measured the expression of fibrotic proteins \u03b1-SMA and Col3a1 in synovial tissue by immunofluorescence. \u03b1-SMA and Col3a1 expression was significantly reduced in the LIPUS group compared to that in the OA group [Fig.\u00a02d\u2013g]. Thus, LIPUS ameliorated synovial fibrosis in OA rats.\nIdentification of the synovial fibrosis-related protein with and without LIPUS through proteomics\nTo investigate the specific target of action of LIPUS for synovial fibrosis, we performed proteomic analysis of serum from the abdominal aorta of rats in the OA group and the LIPUS group. After quality control (QC) of the proteomics data [Fig.\u00a03a], there were 61 up-regulated proteins and 87 down-regulated proteins, respectively [Fig.\u00a03b]. Among them, we present the top 20 significantly differentiated proteins, such as the serine protease inhibitor A11(Serpina11), type 3 collagen a1(Col3a1) and calmodulin 1 (Calm1), etc. [Figure 3c]. Additionally, the volcano diagram displays differentially expressed proteins that are significantly up- or down-regulated. One of these proteins is Col3a1, which is associated with synovial fibrosis [Fig.\u00a03d]. To verify the expression of Col3a1 in vivo, we measured the expression of the fibrotic protein Col3a1 in rat synovial tissue using immunohistochemistry. Col3a1 expression was significantly reduced in the LIPUS group compared to the OA group [Fig.\u00a03e-f]. The results demonstrated that LIPUS has a down-regulating effect on the fibrosis-related protein Col3a1.\nLIPUS inhibits TGF-\u03b2-induced proliferation, inflammation and fibrosis of FLS\nNext, we want to confirm whether LIPUS can hinder TGF-\u03b2-induced proliferation, inflammation and fibrotic change of FLS. First, we conducted in vitro experiments to identify the optimal conditions for TGF-\u03b2 stimulation of rat synovial fibroblast proliferation. CCK8 was used to detect FLS cell proliferation induced by TGF-\u03b2 at five concentrations (0, 1, 5, 10, and 20ng/ml). The proliferation of FLS cells induced by TGF-\u03b2 at different times was measured at the optimal concentration of 10ng/ml [Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a]. The results indicated that cell proliferation was evident at the 48-hour time point [Supplementary Fig.\u00a04b]. And the results of the EdU proliferation experiment indicated that TGF-\u03b2 induced FLS proliferation [Fig.\u00a04a-b]. Furthermore, the qPCR results demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 enhanced the expression of inflammatory genes in FLS [Fig.\u00a04c]. On the other hand, we further clarify that TGF-\u03b2 upregulated fibrosis-related genes and proteins, such as \u03b1-SMA, Col3a1, and Col1a1[Figure 4d-g]. In brief, TGF-\u03b2 can induce the proliferation, inflammation and fibrotic phenotype of FLS.\nMoreover, the results of the EdU proliferation experiment indicate that LIPUS treatment inhibited TGF-\u03b2-induced FLS proliferation [Fig.\u00a04a-b]. Additionally, the qPCR results indicated that LIPUS treatment resulted in the downregulation of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 expression in FLS [Fig.\u00a04c]. Together with this, western blot and qPCR analyze revealed that LIPUS inhibited the expression of fibrotic molecules of FLS [Fig.\u00a04h-k]. These results indicate that TGF-\u03b2 induces proliferation, inflammation and fibrotic changes of FLS, while LIPUS inhibits TGF-\u03b2-induced proliferation, inflammation and fibrotic changes of FLS. Thus, LIPUS can inhibit TGF-\u03b2-induced proliferation, inflammation and fibrosis in FLS.\nPI3K/AKT pathway promotes TGF-\u03b2-induced fibrosis of FLS\nThe potential for the PI3K/AKT pathway to promote TGF-\u03b2-induced fibrotic change in FLS remains uncertain. Therefore, to elucidate the role of the PI3K/AKT pathway in TGF-\u03b2-induced fibrotic change of FLS, 740 Y-P, and LY294002 were used to activate and inhibit this pathway, respectively. Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of pathway proteins. The results indicated that the expression of the p-PI3K and p-AKT proteins was up-regulated after treatment of synovial fibroblasts with 740 Y-P, while the expression of the p-PI3K and p-AKT proteins was down-regulated after treatment of FLS with LY294002 [Fig.\u00a05a\u2013c].\nNext, we measured the expression of fibrosis proteins in TGF-\u03b2-induced FLS. Treatment with 740 Y-P significantly increased the expression of fibrosis proteins, \u03b1-SMA and Col3a1, in FLS. In contrast, LY294002 reduced their expression [Fig.\u00a05d\u2013f]. As a consequence, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway can promote TGF-\u03b2-induced fibrotic phenotype of FLS.\nLIPUS reduces synovial fibrosis via PI3K/AKT/Col3a1 axis\nNext, we explored whether LIPUS relieved synovial fibrosis by inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. To further assess the effect of LIPUS on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, LIPUS was applied to TGF-\u03b2-induced FLS, and western blot analysis was used to measure the related protein expression level of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The results indicated that the expression of PI3K/AKT pathway was significantly increased in TGF-\u03b2-induced FLS, while LIPUS inhibited PI3K/AKT pathway [Fig.\u00a06a\u2013c]. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of OA synovium revealed that LIPUS suppressed the expression of p-AKT protein [Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a-b]. The protein expression of Col3a1 increased significantly after TGF-\u03b2 induction, which was reversed by LIPUS [Fig.\u00a06d-f]. Thus, the PI3K/AKT/Col3a1 axis is an important pathway for the treatment of synovial fibrosis with LIPUS.\nTo further corroborate these results, LIPUS was used to intervene in TGF-\u03b2-induced FLS following the addition of 740 Y-P. The results indicated that LIPUS significantly inhibited the activation effect of this PI3K agonist on this pathway [Fig.\u00a06d\u2013f]. Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway has been demonstrated to inhibit fibrotic changes in FLS. Our findings indicated that LIPUS ameliorated synovial fibrosis by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/Col3a1. The potential mechanism of action of LIPUS on synovial fibrosis in OA is presented in Fig.\u00a06g.\nDiscussion\nSynovial fibrosis is one of the main pathological changes of OA and exacerbates its malignant progression.Besides, synovial fibrosis is considered one of the primary factors affecting joint motion and quality of life, and is characterized by the excessive production of extracellular matrix components and \u03b1SMA expression. Currently, there are clinical treatments for cartilage degeneration, synovial inflammation, and joint effusion. However, limited studies have addressed the treatment and causes of synovial fibrosis. It is therefore imperative that reliable and effective therapies for synovial fibrosis in OA are developed. As a non-invasive, safe and effective treatment method, LIPUS has been widely used for treating bone and joint diseases. Previous studies have indicated that LIPUS exerts a chondroprotective effect.We also found that LIPUS could alleviate cartilage degeneration in OA rats. In summary, these results indicated the beneficial effects of LIPUS in the rat with OA. Therefore, we used LIPUS to treat rats with OA and TGF-\u03b2-induced FLS and examined its effects on synovial fibrosis. The results indicated that LIPUS inhibits synovial fibrosis of OA. Specifically, inhibition of synovial fibrosis by LIPUS occurs via the PI3K/AKT/Col3a1 axis. These findings provide a rationale for studying the mechanism and treatment methods of synovial fibrosis.\nIn the surgically induced OA rat model, pathological changes in synovial tissue were more pronounced 2\u20134 weeks after surgery. In the present study, 4 weeks after surgical induction, there was a notable increase in synovitis and collagen deposition in synovial tissue, as well as fibrotic proteins such \u03b1-SMA and Col3a1. It is worth noting that inflammation can cause an increase in collagen secretion, which leads to more severe fibrosis. Our results suggested that the severity of synovitis is positively correlated with the degree of collagen deposition in synovial fibrosis. As a result, synovitis may contribute to synovial fibrosis. However, the administration of LIPUS was observed to have a significant inhibitory effect on synovial inflammation and fibrosis. In a word, LIPUS may suppresses synovitis and further reduces synovial fibrosis.\nHowever, prior research has suggested that LIPUS is an effective intervention for the treatment of renal and cardiac fibrotic lesions. Additionally, LIPUS has been demonstrated to regulate the function of FLS and chondrocytes in OA. The results of these studies have indicated that the inhibition of synovial fibrosis by LIPUS may be a comprehensive effect. Similarly, our study investigated that LIPUS is capable of inhibiting synovial fibrosis. In order to ascertain the precise target of LIPUS in synovial fibrosis of OA, we conducted proteomic sequencing on the serum of two groups of rats: OA and LIPUS. In this study, some proteins demonstrated a notable increase in the OA group, while a decline was observed in the LIPUS group, including the Col3a1 protein, a marker of fibrosis. On the basis of proteomics, we verified LIPUS downregulated expression Col3a1 protein in synovial tissue by using IHC, which provided more sufficient evidence for subsequent studies. These findings indicated that LIPUS exerts a direct inhibitory effect on synovial fibrosis. FLS are the principal cells involved in synovial fibrosis. Moreover, the function of LIPUS varies between fibroblasts in different tissues. In periodontal ligament fibroblasts, LIPUS suppressed inflammation and promoted BMP9-induced osteogenesis. In cardiac fibroblasts, LIPUS ameliorated cardiac fibrosis by alleviating inflammation via a caveolin-1-dependent pathway. It can be reasonably deduced that LIPUS may play a different role in different tissues and cells. Consequently, it is imperative to investigate the cell-specific effect of LIPUS in synovial fibrosis.\nIn response to prolonged injury, inflammation, or mechanical stress, fibroblasts can undergo a phenotypic transformation into myofibroblasts, which are characterized by \u03b1-SMA expression, collagen-rich extracellular matrix synthesis, and fibroblast proliferation. As a result, the phenotypic alterations observed in FLS in OA are predominantly attributed to their differentiation into myofibroblasts, which in turn gives rise to an excessive production and secretion of extracellular matrix components. This process induces synovial hyperplasia, hypertrophy, and extensive fibrosis, which in turn manifest clinically as joint stiffness and pain. Previous studies have shown that microRNA-27b-3p, cAMP, and pirfenidone inhibit the expression of \u03b1SMA and Col3a1 in the synovium, thereby relieved synovial fibrosis.The present study demonstrated that \u03b1-SMA expression was significantly increased in ACLT\u2009+\u2009MMx-induced synovial tissues of OA rats and TGF-\u03b2-induced FLS. However, LIPUS administration resulted in a reduction in \u03b1-SMA expression in both models. These findings suggest that LIPUS may alleviate synovial fibrosis by inhibiting the transformation of FLS into myofibroblasts.\nIt is widely acknowledged that transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) plays a pivotal role in collagen deposition during the process of fibrosis. Prior research has demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 induced inflammation and fibrosis of FLS. The findings of our study also indicated that not only were fibrotic proteins in FLS significantly upregulated in response to TGF-\u03b2 stimulation, but also that there was a notable increase in the levels of proliferation and inflammation of FLS. Nevertheless, LIPUS has been shown to reverse these alterations. These findings suggest that LIPUS can effectively inhibit proliferation, inflammation and fibrosis of FLS. However, it is not yet clear whether the specific underlying mechanism of LIPUS relieves synovial fibrosis.\nInterestingly, targeting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway inhibited fibrosis in the heart. Furthermore, inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway has been used to treat pulmonary fibrosis and liver fibrosis. Targeting the PI3K/AKT pathway may thus be a viable strategy for inhibiting fibrosis. The study also found that inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway could reduce fibrosis in rat synovial fibroblasts. However, LIPUS has been suggested to exert disparate effects on diverse tissues and cells through its regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In OA, LIPUS inhibited cartilage matrix breakdown by inhibiting the integrin-FAK-PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. It has been indicated that LIPUS alleviated neuronal injury by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/NF-\u03baB pathway.Previous reports have shown that LIPUS promoted the proliferation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells by the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. It can be concluded that LIPUS is capable of regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway directly. Similarly, our findings indicated that LIPUS inhibits the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in FLS. The activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway has been demonstrated to promote fibrosis of FLS. The addition of PI3K agonists to TGF-\u03b2-induced FLS in the presence of LIPUS resulted in a notable reduction in the promotion of fibrosis by PI3K agonists. This further corroborates the hypothesis that LIPUS exerts its anti-fibrotic effects by suppressing the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.\nAs previously stated, FLS in OA can undergo a phenotypic transformation into myofibroblasts, which are characterized by \u03b1-SMA expression and collagen-rich extracellular matrix synthesis. Nevertheless, the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was observed to result in an increased expression of \u03b1-SMA and Col3a1 in FLS, whereas the inhibition of the pathway was found to result in a decreased expression of both. It can thus be postulated that LIPUS may potentially inhibit the transformation of FLS into myofibroblasts by regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which in turn inhibits synovial fibrosis.\nEventually, we found that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway promoted the fibrosis of FLS and LIPUS alleviated synovial fibrosis in OA rats, in part, through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The study presents a theoretical foundation for the clinical use of LIPUS in the treatment of OA and offers novel insights into its mechanism and effective treatment. Although our study demonstrated for the first time that LIPUS attenuates synovial fibrosis by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway, it still has some limitations. Firstly, further studies are necessary to identify additional targets of the PI3K pathway in synovial fibrosis. Secondly, to elucidate the mechanism of action of LIPUS, the investigation of the TGF-\u03b2-induced PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was confined to FLS in this study. However, it is important to note that other cytokines, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TNF-\u03b1, have been observed to induce fibrosis as well. Therefore, in future studies, we may explore the potential of LIPUS to target additional signaling pathways associated with synovial fibrosis.",

        "METHODS": "Method\nEthical statement\nAll experimental protocols involving animals were reviewed and approved by the Animal Research Committee regulations of the Forevergen Medical Experiment Animal Center (No. IACUC-AEWC-F2207019). All research procedures were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Forevergen Medical Research Animal Center. All methods are reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. Eighteen male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from the Southern Medical University Experimental Animal Management Center (Guangzhou, China). These rats were housed in an appropriate temperature and humidity environment with 12\u00a0h of light and 12\u00a0h of darkness per day. Efforts were made to alleviate the suffering of rats.\nGrouping of rats and establishment of an OA model\nEighteen male adult Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks old, 250\u2009\u00b1\u200920\u00a0g) were randomly divided into three groups: normal control (NC), osteoarthritis (OA), and LIPUS (n\u2009=\u20096). The rat OA model was established using anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) combined with partial medial meniscus excision (MMx). Briefly, rats were first placed under general anesthesia by intraperitoneal injection of 2% pentobarbital (40\u00a0mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The hair from the right knee joint of each rat was removed with a shaver and the area was disinfected with iodophor. We aseptically incised the knee joint capsule and dislocated the patella to expose the anterior cruciate ligament and the medial meniscus, and then cut the anterior cruciate ligament with a scalpel. The rat knee joint was then flexed 90 \u00b0 and part of the medial meniscus was removed. After surgery, the joint capsule and skin of each rat were sequentially sutured with surgical sutures and the surgical site was again disinfected with iodophor solution. In the NC group, no surgical treatment was performed. After surgery, the rats were allowed to move freely, eat (experimental rat and mouse food, Huafukang, Beijing, China), and drink water. One of the rats in the LIPUS group did not survive two weeks following the surgical procedure.\nIsolation and culture of rat fibroblast-like synovicytes\nRat fibroblast-like synovicytes (FLS) were obtained from the synovial tissue of the male Sprague-Dawley rat knee joints. Rats aged 8 to 10 weeks were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and immersed in 75% alcohol for 10\u00a0min for disinfection. Ophthalmic scissors were used to cut the joint capsule and the patellar ligament of the rat knee joint. Synovial tissue is a layer of yellow-white tissue located between the patellar ligament and the joint cavity. The removed synovial tissue was washed several times in sterile PBS containing a penicillin-streptomycin solution (15140-122, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Then it was placed in 0.1% type II collagenase (17101015, Gibco) and digested for 6 to 8\u00a0h. After digestion, synovial tissue was converted into synovial fibroblasts. The digested cells were transferred to a 15-ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 5\u00a0min (1000\u00a0rpm). The supernatant and oil were discarded and the remaining cells were transferred to high-glucose DMEM (10-013-CV, Corning, Corning, NY, USA) containing 10% FBS (10099141\u00a0C, Gibco) and 1% penicillin - streptomycin solution. Cells were grown in a cell culture incubator at 37 \u00b0 C and 5% CO2.\nTGF-\u03b2 intervention parameters and LIPUS treatment parameters\nThese cells were digested and seeded in 6-well plates at a cell density of 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells/well and randomly divided into 3 groups: Control, TGF-\u03b2, and LIPUS. The center frequency of the 4\u00a0cm transducer (LIPUSTIM\u00ae Acoustic Dynamic Therapy System, SXULTRASONIC, Shenzhen, China) is 1.5\u00a0MHz, the average intensity is 30mW/cm2, the pulse repetition rate is 1000hz and the duty cycle is 20%, where its output acoustic power is 0.026\u00a0W. Animals and cells were treated with the same therapeutic parameters, which were selected based on previous studies.\nIn vitro experiments, cells were treated with 10ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 (MA0623, Meilunbio, Dalian, China) to observe the effects of TGF-\u03b2 on proliferation, inflammation and fibrosis. After TGF-\u03b2 stimulation, ultrasound therapy was administered and ultrasound therapy was performed every 12\u00a0h, with a total of 4 times. The LIPUS simulations were conducted in a sterile environment at room temperature. LIPUS transducer was fixed at the bottom of a 6-well plate covered by acoustic gel to ensure optimal ultrasound exposure. The PI3K agonist 740 Y-P (HY-P0175, MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (HY-10108, MedChemExpress) at a concentration of 10\u00b5M were used to verify whether LIPUS regulates synovial fibrosis through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Cell samples were collected after the treatment for qPCR, WB, and other experiments.\nIn vivo experiments, each rat was treated with ultrasound once a day for 20\u00a0min, beginning the first day after animal modeling and lasting 4 weeks. During treatment, the right knee joint of the rat was fixed to a specific device after approximately 100 \u00b0 flexion, the hair around the knee joint of the rats was shaved, and then a layer of coupling gel was applied between the front of the right knee joint and the transducer to ensure optimal ultrasound exposure. The distance between the transducer and the right knee joint was approximately 2\u20134\u00a0mm, which was fixed and kept constant in all experiments. The period of ultrasound treatment is fixed at 3\u20136 PM every day to ensure the stability of the intervention, while not affecting normal rest and rest of the animals. Rats were anesthetized in the afternoon of the second day after treatment and right knee joint and serum samples from rats were collected for subsequent animal experiments.\nHistopathology\nThe right knee joint of the rat was harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution (SH268C, Sihe Biotechnology, Guangzhou, China) for 48\u00a0h, and then the tissue was decalcified with a decalcifying solution (G1105-500ML, Servicebio, Wuhan, China). For calcium, decalcification is continued for six to eight weeks. After decalcification, dehydration was performed using a dehydrator (ASP300S, Leica, Germany) and finally a paraffin embedding machine (TB718C, Taiwei, Wuhan, China) and a Leica microtome (HistoCore BIOCUT R, Leica, Germany) were used for embedding and sectioning. The paraffin-embedded knee tissues were cut into 5\u00a0\u03bcm sections continuously. Safranin fast green (S8884-25G, 2353-45-9, SIGMA, American), toluidine blue (G3668, Solarbio, Beijing, China), HE (1121A22, 1129A21, Leagene, Beijing, China) and Masson stain (G1340, Solarbio, Beijing, China) were used for staining according to the kit manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scoring system was used to assess the degree of cartilage degeneration in the knee joint. The synovitis score and the collagen deposition score were used to evaluate knee joint synovitis and synovial fibrosis. The above scores were classified by two independent investigators. They were aware of the grading criteria for the above stains and were blinded to the group to which each sample was assigned.\nImmunohistochemistry\nAfter tissue sections were deparaffinized and hydrated, antigen repair was performed in a microwave oven using TE9.0 antigen repair solution (G1203-250ML, Servicebio, Wuhan, China). This was followed by incubation in hydrogen peroxide solution (35000, Thermo Fisher, USA) and 10% goat serum to block endogenous peroxidase and nonspecific antigens. Tissues were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 1\u00a0h at 25\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0\u00b0C. Finally, a DAB kit (ZLI-9018, Zhongshan Jinqiao, Beijing, China) was used to visualize antibodies in tissue sections. An optical microscope (OLYMPUS BX43, Olympus, Japan) was used to collect visual tissue images and the percentage of positive areas in the tissue was determined using ImageJ software. Five high-power fields were randomly selected from each tissue for semi-quantitative analysis. Primary antibodies: MMP13 (1:200; 18165-1-AP; proteintech; USA), Col2a1 (1:1000; 28459-1-AP; proteintech; USA), Col3a1 (1:500; 22734-1-AP; proteintech; USA). Secondary antibody: GR (SA00004-2; proteintech; USA).\nImmunofluorescence\nThe steps prior to primary antibody incubation are similar to those of immunohistochemistry. The only difference is that immunofluorescence does not require blocking with hydrogen peroxide solution. After incubating the tissue with the primary antibody overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, the fluorescent secondary antibody is incubated. It should be noted that the type and color of the secondary antibody must match the primary antibody. DAPI anti-fluorescence quenching mounting medium (S2110, Solarbio, Beijing, China) was used for sealing. Finally, a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS BX43, Olympus, Japan) was used to observe and record the fluorescence images, and the area percentage of positive areas was counted for comparison. Primary antibodies: \u03b1-SMA (1:1000; 14395-1-AP; proteintech; USA), Col3a1 (1:200; 22734-1-AP; proteintech; USA). Fluorescent secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 (1:200, ab150077, abcam, UK), Alexa Fluor\u00ae 594 (1:200, ab150080, abcam, UK).\nProteomics\nWe collected rat abdominal aortic blood in a vacuum blood collection tube through a syringe, left it at room temperature for 30\u201360\u00a0min and then centrifuged at 2500\u00a0g for 15\u00a0min at 4 \u00b0 C. Then transfer the upper layer of light-yellow serum to an EP tube, add a volume of protease inhibitor corresponding to the serum volume, mix, and store quickly at -80\u00a0\u00b0C. The whole process takes no more than two hours. Proteomic detection and bioinformatics analysis were performed by Beip Bio. Three samples were selected from each group for analysis by (data-independent acquisition, DIA) DIA proteomics at Beip Biotech. The resulting data included differentially expressed protein (DEP) data between the OA group and the LIPUS group, as well as Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment data.\nEnzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA)\nBlood was collected from the abdominal aorta of rats, allowed to stand at room temperature for 15\u00a0min, and then centrifuged at 2000\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0min in a 4 \u00b0centrifuge. After centrifugation, the supernatant is stored at -80\u00a0\u00b0C until needed for the experiment. IL-6 ELISA kit (MM-0190R1, ELISA, Yancheng, China), IL-8 ELISA kit (MM-71113R1, ELISA, Yancheng, China), IL-1\u03b2 ELISA kit (MM-0047R1, ELISA kit (MM-0180R1, ELISA, Yancheng, China), TNF-\u03b1 ELISA kit (MM-0180R1, ELISA, Yancheng, China) to detect the expression levels of inflammatory factors in serum; PIIINP ELISA kit (MM-0039R1, ELISA, Yancheng, China), LN ELISA kit (MM-0843R1, ELISA, Yancheng, China) and HA ELISA kit (MM-0511R1, ELISA, Yancheng, China) were used to detect the expression levels of fibrosis-related proteins in serum. All procedures were performed quantitatively according to the kit manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nCell count kit 8 (CCK8)\nWe use the CCK8 kit (HY-K0301, MCE, USA) to detect the viability of FLS. We seeded FLS in a 96-well plate at a cell density of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 cells/well and incubated for 12\u00a0h to allow cells to adhere. Then, different concentrations of TGF-\u03b2 were added to intervene in FLS at different time points, and 5 duplicate wells were established in each group. After intervention, 10ul of CCK8 reagent was added to each well in the dark and cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0 C for 1\u20134\u00a0h. The specific time is determined on the basis of the optical density. After incubation, the optical density value at a wavelength of 450\u00a0nm was detected in a microplate reader (SYNERGYHTX, BioTek, USA), and finally, the vitality of FLS was calculated based on the OD value.\nEdU cell proliferation experiment\nThe EdU-555 cell proliferation detection kit (C0075S, Beyotime, Shanghai, China) was used to evaluate the proliferation of FLS. According to the kit instructions, cells were seeded in a 24 well plate at 100,000 cells per well. Cells were starved for 12\u00a0h in culture medium containing 1% fetal calf serum, then replaced with culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for normal culture, and TGF-\u03b2 was added to stimulate cells. At the same time, LIPUS was used to act on the cells, every other time every 12\u00a0h, for a total of 4 treatments of 20\u00a0min each. After preheating the prepared 2X EdU working solution to 37\u00a0\u00b0C, equal volumes are mixed with culture medium, added to the 24-well plate and incubated for 2\u00a0h. After EdU labeling of the cells, remove the medium and add 1\u00a0ml of 4% paraformaldehyde fixative to each well to fix the cells at room temperature for 15\u00a0min. After fixation, wash cells with PBS. Add 1 mL of permeabilization solution to each well and incubate at room temperature for 15\u00a0min, then add Click reaction solution for staining. Finally, cells were incubated with Hoechst 33,342 at 37 \u00b0 C for 10\u00a0min. After incubation, five field of view were randomly selected using a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS BX43, Olympus, Japan) for photography and recording.\nQuantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)\nTRIzol reagent (NR0002, Regan Biotechnology, Beijing, China) was used to extract RNA from rat synovial fibroblasts. We used HiScript III RT SuperMix (R323-01, Novozymes, Nanjing, China) to reverse transcribe RNA to generate a cDNA template and then used the SYBR Premix Ex TaqTMII kit (RP820A, Takara, Beijing, China) on a Roche fluorescence quantitative PCR instrument (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed on a LightCycler 96, Roche, Switzerland). According to the requirements of the reagent supplier, each group of samples was prepared in three copies. The primers are as follows:\nThe results were normalized using GAPDH as an internal reference. The relative expression level of each gene\u2019s mRNA was calculated using the formula(2(\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct)). Primers were purchased from Qingke Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China).\nWestern blot\nWe used RIPA lysis buffer (KGP702-100, KGI, Nanjing, China) containing protease inhibitors (78442, Thermo Fisher, USA) to extract proteins from synovial fibroblasts, and the BCA kit (23225, Thermo Fisher, USA) was used to detect the concentration of collected proteins. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF membrane (IPVH00010, Merck, Germany). After blocking with 5% skim milk (GC310001-100\u00a0g, Sevier, Wuhan, China) for 1.5\u00a0h at room temperature, the PVDF membrane was incubated with primary antibody at 4 \u00b0 C overnight. Then it was incubated with the secondary antibody for 1\u00a0h at 24\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0\u00b0C, and the membrane was visualized with the chemiluminescence substrate ECL (FD8020, Ford Biotechnology, Hangzhou, China), and finally a chemical reflectometer (Tanon 5200CE, Tanon, Shanghai, China) was used. Photographing and recording protein bands. Using TUBULIN as an internal control, a relative quantitative analysis of the gray value of the target protein band was performed using ImageJ software. Primary antibodies include TUBULIN (PTM-5001, Jingjie Biotech, Hangzhou, China); \u03b1-SMA (1:6000, 14395-1-AP, Proteintech, USA); Col3a1 (1:500, 22734-1-AP, Proteintech, USA); PI3K (1:400; 20584-1-AP, Proteintech, USA); p-PI3K (1:1000; AF3241, Affinity, China); AKT (1: 6000, 60203-2-Ig, proteintech, USA); p-AKT (1:6000, 66444-1-Ig, proteintech, USA); secondary antibodies include: biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H\u2009+\u2009L) (SA00004-2, proteintech, USA); biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H\u2009+\u2009L) (SA00004-1, proteintech, U. S).\nStatistical analysis\nAll experiments were repeated at least three times and the results were expressed as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism software (version 8.0.1). Student\u2019s t-test was used for comparisons between two groups, and one-way analysis of variance was used for comparisons among three or more groups. When the data did not conform to a normal distribution, the paired Wilcoxon test was used for comparisons between two groups, and the paired Friedman test was used for comparisons between three or more groups, followed by the Dunn post hoc test. p\u2009<\u20090.05 indicated statistical significance. The number of replicates for all in vivo experiments was consistent with the number of animals in each group. All in vitro experiments were repeated three times.",

        "TITLE": "GPAT4 sustains endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis in endocardial cells and safeguards heart development",
        "ABSTRACT": "The endocardium plays a pivotal role in governing myocardial development, and understanding the intrinsic regulatory insights will help apprehend pathological cardiomyopathy. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 4 (GPAT4) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane anchored protein. While the role of GPAT4 in glycerophospholipid biosynthesis is well established, its function in the ER is less explored. Here, we generate Gpat4 global and tissue-specific knockout mice and identify the essential role of GPAT4 in endocardial development. Deficiency of GPAT4 provokes endocardial ER stress response and enhances ER-mitochondrial (ER-mito) communications, leading to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) escape. As a result, the cGAS-STING pathway is triggered to stimulate type-I-interferon response, which affects heart development. Finally, abolishment of the cGAS-STING-type-I-interferon pathway rescues the heart defects of Gpat4 deletion mice. These findings uncover the pivotal role of GPAT4 in the maintenance of ER homeostasis during endocardial and heart development. Meanwhile, this study highlights the importance of the cGAS-STING pathway in cardiac organogenesis.\nHere the authors identify a role of GPAT4 in endocardial and myocardial development through maintaining ER homeostasis. GPAT4 deficiency triggers ER stress, ER-mitochondrial dysfunction, and activation of the cGAS-STING-type I IFN response, leading to severe heart malformation.",
        "INTRO": "Introduction\nThe endocardium is a specialized endothelial tissue covering the inner layer of the heart. The endocardium plays a crucial role in cardiac development because it participates in myocardial trabeculation and compaction, and contributes to coronary vascular formation. These developmental processes are modulated by interactions and reciprocal regulations between the endocardium and the myocardium through signaling molecules. The precise coordination between endocardial cells and cardiomyocytes has been demonstrated as crucial for ventricular growth and chamber maturation. Abnormal endocardial development often results in excessive trabeculation and poor myocardial formation. Understanding endocardial development will help decipher the pathogenesis of defective ventricular myocardium, such as the left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC), illustrated with enormous trabeculae and poorly developed myocardium that frequently leads to heart failure.\nGPATs (glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases) function in the Kennedy pathway of glycerophospholipid biosynthesis, and are rate-limiting enzymes for triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis. GPATs consist of four members: GPAT1-4. While GPAT1 and 2 are localized in the mitochondria, GPAT3 and 4 are membrane-anchored proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).\nThe ER forms a vast membrane network in the cells, which extends from the nuclear envelope outward to the cellular membrane. The ER is responsible for protein translocation, protein folding, and protein post-translational modification. It is also a place to store calcium and for lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Perturbation of ER functions triggers ER stress response, which further prompts a series of adaptive mechanisms including ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and the unfolded protein response (UPR), to counteract the elevated ER stress. The UPR in the ER is mediated by three transcriptional programs: 1. PERK-p-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4-CHOP; 2. ATF6; and 3. IRE1-XBP1. Activation of UPR frequently exerts impact on mitochondrial functions. For instance, maladaptive UPR affects the ER-mitochondrial (ER-Mito) communications/contacts and a large amount of Ca2+ are transferred from ER to mitochondria, causing mitochondrial Ca2+ overloading and escape of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to intracellular compartments. Cytosolic mtDNA provokes cGAS-STING pathway leading to type I interferon response, which may initiate cytotoxic effects, such as induction of cell apoptosis.\nAlthough the role of GPAT4 in glycerophospholipid biosynthesis (Kennedy pathway) in the central tissues for de novo lipogenesis (adipose tissues and the liver) is well established, its function in ER biology is still elusive. Here, we show the pivotal function of GPAT4 in the maintenance of ER homeostasis and in fine-tuning ER-Mito communication, which plays an essential role in endocardial and heart development. Meanwhile, we pinpointed the importance of cGAS-STING pathway in cardiac organogenesis.",
        "RESULTS": "Results\nDefective heart development in Gpat4 global knockout mice\nTo understand the physiological role of GPAT4, we generated Gpat4 global knockout (KO) mice via CRISPR\u2013Cas9 technology (Figure\u00a0S1A). Gpat4 KO mice were found embryonic lethal at around E18.5 (Figure S1B). Dissection of embryos at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) and E15.5 revealed obvious subcutaneous edema of Gpat4 KO mice, suggesting of impaired cardiovascular development (Fig.\u00a01A). Morphological and histological examination of the hearts detected dilated ventricles with thinned myocardial wall (Myo) and excessive trabeculae (Tra) in the heart of Gpat4 KO mice (Fig.\u00a01B\u2013E, S1C). Cell proliferation was prominently decreased in the KO heart (Fig.\u00a01F, G). Western blotting analysis confirmed absence of GPAT4 protein in the KO mice, and uncovered a significant increase of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX but a profound reduction of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 in the heart tissues of KO mice (Fig.\u00a01H, I). Whole mount immunofluorescence staining displayed severely disrupted coronary vascular formation in the KO mice (Fig.\u00a01J\u2013N).\nTaken together, these findings define the crucial function of GPAT4 in embryonic heart development.\nEssential role of GPAT4 in endocardial development\nNext, we generated Gpat4 conditional (Gpat4 flox) mice for tissue-specific deletion. The excessive trabeculation and thinned myocardial layer in the Gpat4 global knockout mice suggests of endocardial defects. Endocardial cells are specialized endothelial cells, and we therefore, deleted Gpat4 using endothelial-specific Cre mice (Tie2-Cre). Similar to the global knockout mice, endothelial-specific deletion of Gpat4 (Tie2-Cre; Gpat4F/F) mice were unable to survive and exhibited prominent subcutaneous edema and enlarged heart at E14.5 (Fig.\u00a02A, S2A, B). Histological analysis and immuno-fluorescence staining revealed heart dilation and confirmed successful removal of Gpat4 in the endocardial cells of knockout mice (Fig.\u00a02B\u2013E). It was noticed that the trabecular layer was exaggerated but the myocardial layer appeared thinner in the heart of knockout mice compared to control (Fig.\u00a02D, E). EdU staining demonstrated reduced cell proliferation in the heart of Gpat4-deficient mice (Fig. 2F, G). Western blotting analysis confirmed effective deletion of Gpat4, and indicated increased cell apoptosis in the heart of knockout mice (Fig.\u00a02H, I). In addition, the cardiac vasculature in the knockout mice was found abnormal (Fig.\u00a02J\u2013N). These results were consistent with those observed in the global knockout mice.\nFurthermore, we deleted Gpat4 particularly in the endocardial cells using Nfatc1-Cre mice and detected similar phenotypes to those seen in the whole and endothelial-specific knockout mice (Fig.\u00a02O\u2013R).\nFinally, ex vivo heart explant culture using ventricular tissues from Tie2-Cre; Gpat4F/F mice, unveiled profoundly reduced outward migration of endocardial cells compared to control (Fig. S2C\u2013G). Scratch assays in HUVECs demonstrated that knockdown of Gpat4 impaired cell migration (Fig. S2H, I).\nCollectively, these results have proved the essential role of GPAT4 in endocardial development.\nGPAT4 deficiency triggered ER stress response and enhanced ER-mitochondrial communications\nGPAT4 is a rate-limiting enzyme of TAG synthesis in the adipocytes and hepatocytes, and the GPAT family consists of four members: GPAT1-4. The levels of TAG, together with the other phospholipids including phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) were examined in the hearts and whole embryos but no big differences were detected between control and Gpat4 deletion mice (Figure\u00a0S3A\u2013C). RNA-seq and qPCR analyses of heart tissues demonstrated unchanged mRNA levels of Gpat1, Gpat2, and Gpat3 upon Gpat4 deletion (Figure\u00a0S3D\u2013G). These findings exclude the possibility that Gpat4 affects cardiac development through regulation of phospholipid synthesis.\nRNA-seq analysis using heart tissues from E14.5 embryos uncovered significant upregulation in the expression of genes involved in ER-stress response, such as Eif2ak3 (encoding the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase, PERK), heat shock protein 90 beta family member 1 (Hsp90b1), Atf4, Atf6 and Xbp1 (Fig.\u00a03A). These changes were validated by qPCR and Western blotting analysis (Fig.\u00a03B\u2013D).\nThe above results suggest of a critical function of GPAT4 in maintaining ER homeostasis. To understand this, we performed immuno-precipitation\u00a0(IP) using GPAT4 antibody, and searched for GPAT4-binding proteins through mass spectrometry analysis in the endothelial cell line of HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cell). This experiment led to identification of about 30 potential GPAT4 binding proteins. We then performed bioinformatical analysis of the biological processes (BP) in which these proteins participate, of the cellular compartments (CC) where these proteins are located, and of molecular functions (MF) that these proteins perform. The results uncovered that these proteins were involved in protein folding and refolding, are mainly located in the ER, and function to bind misfolded or unfolded proteins, and to process proteins in the ER (Fig.\u00a03E, F). Among these proteins, some belong to the heat shock protein 70 family (HSPA1A, HSPA1B, HSPA1L and HSPA6) and some are important regulators of ER stress response (EIF2S1/eIF2\u03b1, PDIA4 and P4HB) (Fig.\u00a03F).\nNext, we investigated how GPAT4 modulates UPR. Using AlphaFold 3 (AF3), an accurate modeling to predict complex formation containing nearly all molecular types, we recognized multiple binding sites between EIF2S1/eIF2\u03b1 and GPAT4 (Fig.\u00a03G). A subsequent IP and Western blotting experiment confirmed the binding between these two proteins (Fig.\u00a03H).\nIt has been widely accepted that PERK phosphorylation of EIF2S1/eIF2\u03b1 regulates UPR to ER stress. Upon putting together the three proteins of PERK, GPAT4 and EIF2S1/eIF2\u03b1, AF3 revealed simultaneous association of PERK with EIF2S1/eIF2\u03b1 as well as GPAT4 with EIF2S1/eIF2\u03b1. Nonetheless, no direct association between PERK and GPAT4 was predicted by AF3 (Fig.\u00a03I). Once leaving GPAT4 out of the three proteins assembly, AF3 predicted a substantial increase in the binding ability between PERK and EIF2S1/eIF2\u03b1 (Fig.\u00a03J) when compared to the presence of GPAT4 (Fig.\u00a03I). Similarly, AF3 predicted a much stronger association of GPAT4 with EIF2S1/eIF2\u03b1 compared to the presence of PERK (Fig.\u00a03G). These results suggest a competition between GPAT4 and PERK in binding to EIF2S1/eIF2\u03b1.\nIP-Western blotting analysis demonstrated a stronger binding of PERK to EIF2S1/eIF2\u03b1 upon GPAT4 knockdown compared to control (Fig.\u00a03K). Consistently, GPAT4 overexpression (OE) markedly reduced the association between PERK to EIF2S1 (Fig.\u00a03L). As a result, activation of the UPR pathways were greatly reduced upon GPAT4 OE and the levels of phospho- EIF2S1/eIF2\u03b1, CHOP and ATF4 were remarkably dropped (Fig.\u00a03M, N).\nFurther investigation of endocardial cells using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) displayed evident ER swelling and abnormal mitochondria in the Tie2-Cre; Gpat4F/F mice (Fig.\u00a03O). Additionally, profoundly enhanced ER-mitochondrial (ER-Mito) contacts (MAMs) were observed in the endocardial cell of the Tie2-Cre; Gpat4F/F mice (Fig.\u00a03O, P). The ER-Mito contacts are tethered by the calcium transport channel IP3R-GRP75-VDAC1-MCU and MFN2. Western blotting analysis demonstrated a significantly increased level of these proteins in the heart tissues of Gpat4 mutant mice compared to control (Fig.\u00a03Q, R).\nTaken together, these results indicate that GPAT4 is critical in maintaining ER homeostasis, whose disruption causes ER stress response leading to enhanced UPR-ER and ER-Mito communications.\nGpat4 deletion elicited cGAS-STING and type I interferon response\nKEGG and GO analyses of the RNA-seq datasets using heart tissues from the E14.5 mice, indicated a significant enrichment of pathways related to the type I interferon response in the Tie2-Cre; Gpat4F/F mice (Fig.\u00a04A, B). Among the upregulated genes, many were interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including Usp18, Isg15, Ifit1, Ifna4, Stat1 and DDX58. This changed pattern of gene expression profile was also defined in the heart tissues (at both E12.5 and E14.5) of Gpat4 global knockout mice (Figure\u00a0S4A\u2013F). qPCR analysis confirmed these findings (Figs.\u00a04C, S4G, H).\nOne important trigger of type I interferon response is activation of the cGAS-STING-TBK1-IRF3 signaling pathway. We tested this signaling pathway by Western blotting and the results demonstrated that the protein levels of cGAS, STING, phospho-TBK1 and phospho-IRF3 were all significantly elevated in the heart tissues from either endothelial-specific or global Gpat4 knockout mice (Figs.\u00a04D, E, S4I, J). Immunofluorescence staining revealed augmented cGAS and STING proteins were localized to the endocardium (Fig.\u00a04F\u2013I).\nWe noticed that activation of the ER response occurred earlier than that of the cGAS-STING pathway (Figure\u00a0S4K\u2013N). While ATF4 showed markedly enhanced presence in the endocardium of Gpat4 mutant mice at E11.5 (Figure\u00a0S4K, L), cGAS was nearly undetectable in these mice (Figure\u00a0S4M, N). In addition, the numbers of genes with substantially enhanced expression levels in E14. 5 heart tissues were much bigger than those in E12.5 heart (Figure\u00a0S4B, C, E, F), which was confirmed by fold changes (Figure\u00a0S4G, H). The fold changes in E14.5 heart tissues were similarly much more than in E12.5 heart tissues.\nSTING is localized in the membrane of ER as GPAT4. In the IP-MS results of GPAT4, the Sting protein was not detected. Immuno-precipitation test did not find a direct interaction between GPAT4 and STING (Figure\u00a0S5A).\nIn addition, we examined the cGAS-STING pathway in the heart tissues from cardiomyocyte-specific Gpat4 deletion mice (cTnt-Cre mediated deletion, viable) and failed to detected a difference between the control and knockout mice (Figure\u00a0S5B\u2013D).\nPut together, these findings suggest that disruption of Gpat4 triggered the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, resulting in activation of type I interferon response in the endocardium. These events occurred after the activation of ER stress response.\nEndothelial loss of GPAT4 resulted in augmented ER-Mito communication, mitochondrial dysfunction, and activation of cGAS-STING pathway\nNext, we performed experiments in HUVEC cells to study the relation of Gpat4 knockdown and activation of cGAS-STING pathway. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology was applied to achieve Gpat4 knockdown. Loss of Gpat4 impaired cell survival (Fig.\u00a05A). Western blotting analysis demonstrated substantially increased protein levels of pro-apoptotic BAX, Cytochrome-C (Cyto-c) and cleaved Caspase-3 but markedly reduced anti-apoptotic BCL2 upon Gpat4 knockdown (Fig.\u00a05B, C). qPCR and Western blotting analysis indicated enhanced ER stress response in SiGpat4 cells (Fig.\u00a05D\u2013F). The protein levels of the ER-Mito contacts components (IP3R, GRP75, VDAC1, MCU and MFN2) were profoundly augmented in Gpat4 knockdown cells (Fig.\u00a05G, H). Consistently, immuno-fluorescence staining revealed closer proximity between the ER and mitochondria (Fig.\u00a05I), along with an increase in the number of ER-Mito contacts (MAMs) that was measured with a fluorescence MERCs (Mito-ER Contact Sites) reporter to detect ER-Mito contacts (approaching of ER with Mito produces functional GFP) (Fig.\u00a05J). Disruption of Gpat4 also gave rise to hyper-activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway and type I interferon response (Fig.\u00a05K\u2013M).\nFluorescent Ca2+ probes (Rhod-2, monitoring mitochondrial Ca2+) and OMM-NEMOs-mKate-ER (a recently developed Ca2+ indicator for measurement of Ca2+ in the ER-Mito contacts) analysis revealed apparently more Ca2+ signals in the mitochondria and in the ER-Mito contacts in SiGpat4 cells than that of control (Fig.\u00a05N, O). Mitochondrial membrane potential (measured using TMRE and JC-1 probes) was reduced while MitoSox signal (superoxide generated in the mitochondria) was prominently enhanced upon Gpat4 knockdown (Fig.\u00a05P\u2013S). Co-staining of dsDNA and TOM20 revealed an increased presence of leaked mtDNA in the cytoplasm after Gpat4 knockdown (Fig.\u00a05T). Additionally, measurement of cytoplasmic mtDNA content displayed a significant increase in the GPAT4 knockdow cells (Fig.\u00a05V). VDAC is a mitochondrial membrane protein and constitutes the channel for mtDNA release. The VDAC oligomerization inhibitor VBIT-4 can suppress mtDNA release. We observed a remarkable reduction of expression levels of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) after VBIT-4 treatment compared to untreated cells (Fig.\u00a05W), which further supports the conclusion that the release of mtDNA activates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway.\nIn the myocardial cell line H9c2, reducing GPAT4 levels showed little impact on pro- and anti- apoptotic proteins (Figure\u00a0S6A, B). ER stress response and cGAS-STING were comparable between control and SiGpat4 cells (Figure\u00a0S6C, D).\nCollectively, these in vitro studies demonstrate that loss of GPAT4 caused augmented ER-Mito communications, mitochondrial dysfunction, and activation of cGAS-STING pathway specifically in the endothelial cells.\nBlockage of the cGAS-STING pathway rescued the endocardial defects of Gpat4-deficient mice\nTo test whether blockage the cGAS-STING pathway would improve endocardial development in Gpat4 knockout mice, we generated double knockout mice for Gpat4/Ifnar1. Ifnar1 encodes interferon a and b receptor 1 (IFNAR1) that mediates type I interferon response. At E14.5, Gpat4-/-; Ifnar1-/- (DKO) mice exhibited no subcutaneous edema or cardiac dilation (Fig.\u00a06A, B). Moreover, endocardial and myocardial development in the DKO mice was comparable to that of control. (Fig.\u00a06C, D). ER stress response in the DKO mice was similar to that of Gpat4 KO mice (Fig.\u00a06E). However, the genes downstream of type I interferon signaling demonstrated a significant decrease in the DKO mice compared to the Gpat4-/- mice (Fig.\u00a06F). At the protein level, IFNAR1 in the hearts of E14.5 DKO mice was markedly reduced, and apoptosis-related proteins BAX and BCL2 exhibited reversed changes compared to Gpat4-/- mice (Fig.\u00a06G, H). In addition, DKO mice for Gpat4/Sting (Gpat4-/-; Sting-/-) were produced and these mice showed no edema or cardiac dilation, and the heart development was similar to control (Fig.\u00a06I\u2013L). At the mRNA level, ER stress response in the DKO mice was similar to that of Gpat4 KO mice, while the genes downstream of type I interferon signaling showed significantly decreased levels (Fig.\u00a06M, N). At the protein level, apoptosis-related proteins manifested reversed changes compared to Gpat4-/- mice (Fig.\u00a06O, P).\nCollectively, these findings demonstrated that blockage of the cGAS-STING pathway is beneficial to heart development in the Gpat4 KO mice, and further confirm that endocardial defects are a result of hyper-activation of type I interferon response.",
        "DISCUSS": "Discussion\nIn this study, we defined an essential function of GPAT4 in endocardial and heart development through sustaining ER homeostasis in the endocardial cells. Disruption of GPAT4 evokes ER stress response and enhances ER-Mito communications, leading to mitochondrial Ca2+ overloading and mtDNA escape (Fig.\u00a07A, B). As a result, the cGAS-STING pathway is triggered to elicit type I interferon response, which impairs endocardial survival and heart development (Fig.\u00a07A, B). Thus, we unraveled unique regulatory insights of GPAT4-mediated ER-Mito communication and cGAS-STING pathway on endocardial and heart development.\nOur work highlights a unique role of GPAT4 in endocardial ER homeostatic maintenance, which is crucial for endocardial and heart development. GPAT4 demonstrates a competitive association with EIF2S1/eIF2a against PERK to hinder UPR to ER stress response, stabilizing EIF2S1/eIF2a in the ER.\nIn the central lipogenic cells for glycerophospholipid biosynthesis, such as adipocytes and hepatocytes, GPAT4 plays a critical role as one of the rate-limiting enzymes in the Kennedy pathway. However, the involvement of GPAT4 in endocardial development seems independent from lipid biosynthesis because the endocardial cells are not responsible for lipid storage and we detected very low level of TAG in these cells. In addition, no big differences in the levels of phospholipids including TAG, PC, PE and PI between Gpat4 KO and control mice support this assumption.\nOur study demonstrated the fine-tuning of ER-Mito communications and cGAS-STING pathway in heart development. These biological processes have been reported in pathological heart disease in the adults but their involvement in heart development has never been reported.\nOrganelle biology is an emerging new frontier for biomedical study to address questions in cell biology and developmental biology, and to understand diseases from novel aspects. We and others observed the critical role of mitochondria in myocardial development in mouse models and our recent studies indicate severe consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction in myocardial formation. On the other hand, the current work uncovered a pivotal role of GPAT4-mediated ER homeostasis in endocardial development, which pinpoints the importance of ER in sustaining endocardial and heart development. However, the current study suggests that GPAT4 is dispensable for cardiomyocyte ER homeostasis and for myocardial development. A plausible argument lies in that the ER in cardiomyocytes are sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that functions to regulate Ca2+ transport and excitation-contraction coupling, while ER plays a regulatory role in protein synthesis, modification and secretion, and lipid synthesis. There was a previous study demonstrating that pregnant hyperglycemia (diabetes) could provoke ER stress in the embryonic heart and affect heart development. Whether is GPAT4 participating this pathological process is unknown.\nIn the future, we are interested in exploring the function of GPAT4 in the cardiomyocytes of adult mice to understand whether it plays an important role in cardiac physiology and pathology.\nIn conclusion, our study elucidates the intricate regulatory roles of Gpat4 in endocardial cells during embryonic heart development. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac development and provide a foundation for potential therapeutic strategies aimed at addressing cardiac developmental abnormalities.",

(GPAT4 LOSS) In the absence of GPAT4, ER homeostasis is disrupted and ER stress response is triggered by phosphorylating EIF2S1/EIF2\u03b1, leading to enhanced ER-Mito communications, which in turn, causes Mito Ca2+ overloading and mtDNA escape. As a result, cGAS-STING-type I interferon response is elicited, which induces endocardial apoptosis. In the end, this leads to defective trabecular compaction (poor myocardial development) and excessive trabeculation. (Created in BioRender. zhao, t. (2025) https://BioRender.com/m79n092).",
        "METHODS": "Methods\nMice\nGpat4+/- mice were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Gpat4 flox, Ifnar1+/- and Sting+/- mice were obtained from Gempharmatech Co. Ltd. (Nanjing, China). Tie2-Cre, Nfatc1-Cre, and cTnT-Cre mice were as previously reported. All mouse strains were maintained on a C57BL/6 genetic background. Mice were group-housed in accordance with the regulations on mouse welfare and ethics of Nanjing University, with 12\u2009h/12\u2009h light\u2013dark cycles and ad libitum access to food and water. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Nanjing University approved all animal procedures used in this study. All primers used in genotyping these mice are listed in Table\u00a0S1.\nImmunofluorescence (IF) staining\nEmbryos and hearts fixed in 4% PFA were dehydrated and embedded in OCT medium (Sukura, 4583). Eight-micrometer-thick sections were cut using a Leica CM1950 automated cryostat. For IF staining, sections were placed at room temperature for 20\u2009min and washed in PBS. Goat serum (Beyotime, C0265) was used to block the sections, which were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The next day, the sections were washed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies for 2\u2009h. Finally, the sections were washed again in PBS and sealed with 50% glycerol before confocal imaging. Detailed information of the antibodies used are shown in Table\u00a0S2.\nIn vivo EdU labelling\nTo assess proliferation rates in embryonic hearts, pregnant mice were intraperitoneally injected with 50\u2009mg/kg body weight of EdU (RIBIO, C10371) 48\u2009hours prior to dissection. Embryonic hearts were then isolated for cryosectioning analysis. EdU incorporation was detected using the Apollo EdU 567 reagent.\nWhole-mount immunofluorescence and imaging of embryonic hearts\nWhole embryos at E15.5 were dissected, and their chests were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Aladdin C104188) on ice for 5\u2009h with shaking. The chests were then washed with shaking for 2\u2009\u00d7\u20098\u2009min in PBS at room temperature. The hearts were excised and cut on the ventral side for artery morphological analysis and on the dorsal side for venous morphological analysis. For immunostaining, hearts were blocked and permeabilized in Goat Serum (BOSTER, AR0009) for 2\u2009h at room temperature with shaking. Primary antibodies were added to 0.5% PBST solution, and hearts were incubated at 4\u2009\u00b0C overnight with shaking. The following day, hearts were washed in 0.5% PBST for 5\u2009\u00d7\u200912\u2009min to remove unbound primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies were diluted in PBT, and samples were incubated at 4\u2009\u00b0C overnight with shaking, followed by 5\u2009\u00d7\u200912\u2009min washed in PBT the next day. Large Z-volumes of the samples were imaged using different objectives and tile scanning on Leica SP8 Navigator microscopes.\nProtein interaction prediction\nAlphaFold 3, an accurate modeling to predict complex formation containing nearly all molecular types.

Analysis of the interaction structure using Pymol software.\nExplant culture, immunostaining\nThe left ventricles without atria were isolated from E11.5 embryos, rinsed with PBS to remove blood cells and placed in the Matrigel (Yeasen, 40183\u2009s) with culture media in 35\u2009mm confocal dishes (Beyotime, FCFC020). Explants were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 2 days. Hearts were fixed in 4% PFA for 60\u2009mins, washing the explants with 0.5% PBST three times. Explants were blocked and permeabilized in Goat Serum (BOSTER, AR0009) for 2\u2009hours at room temperature with shaking. Primary antibodies were added to fresh 0.5% PBST solution, and explants were incubated at 4\u2009\u00b0C overnight. The following day, hearts were washed in 0.5% PBST for 5\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2009min to remove unbound primary antibodies and then incubated with corresponding secondary antibodies in 0.5% PBST 2\u2009hours at room temperature. After three washes with PBS for 15\u2009min, the explants were placed in PBS and photographed using a confocal microscope (Olympus, FV3000).\nCell culture and transfection\nHuman Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) were maintained in Gibco DMEM basic (1X) medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin\u2013streptomycin, in the presence of 5% CO2 at 37\u2009\u00b0C incubators. Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies; 11668-027) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Fresh medium was added to the cells 4 to 6\u2009h after transfection. The cells were collected 48 to 72\u2009h after transfection for further analysis. The siRNA sequences were showed in Table\u00a0S3. The two plasmids (Mitot and ERt) of the MERCs (Mito-ER Contacts) reporter and the construct of OMM-NEMOs-mKate-ER were as reported. For GPAT4 overexpression (OE) construct, the sequence of GPAT4 was synthesized by GenePharma Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and then cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector between the HindIII and EcoRI sites to create the pcDNA3.1-GPAT4 plasmid.\nCell survival assay\nAfter trypsinization and centrifugation, the harvested cells were seeded into a 96-well plate (1000 cells/well). A Cell Counting Kit-8 (Yeasen, 40203ES) was used to measure cell viability. In brief, a mixture of medium and CCK-8 reagent was added to the wells, and the plate was incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009h. The absorbance of the wells was measured at 450\u2009nm using a Bio-Rad multimode plate reader (Hercules).\nMeasurement of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake\nThe fluorescent dye Rhod-2/AM (Yeasen, 40776ES) and Mito-Tracker Green (Beyotime, C1048) were used to measure cells mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Briefly, HUVECs cells were incubated with Rhod-2/AM and Mito-Tracker Green to allow the cells to load the dyes according to the protocol. Cells were viewed with a spinning disk confocal super-resolution microscope (Olympus, FV3000) at the following wavelengths: 549\u2009nm (excitation) and 578\u2009nm (emission), and the frame rate was 2 frames/s.\nMitochondrial membrane potential\nTMRE: For Mitochondrial membrane potential assay, treated cells were loaded with the potentiometric dye 500\u2009nM TMRE (Beyotime, C2001S) at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009min and the staining was viewed by a confocal scanning microscope after washing. The fluorescence intensity of the HUVECs was detected with confocal microscopy (Olympus, FV3000) and quantified using Image J software.\nJC-1: Enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential assay kit with JC-1 (Beyotime, C2003S) was used to detect mitochondrial membrane potential. HUVECs were transferred to JC-1 staining solution at 37\u2009\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 30\u2009min the staining was viewed by a confocal scanning microscope after washing. The fluorescence intensity of the HUVECs was detected with confocal microscopy (Olympus, FV3000) and quantified using Image J software.\nMeasurement of mitochondrial oxidative stress\nMitochondrial ROS (mtROS) was detected by MitoSOX red mitochondrial superoxide indicator (Yeasen, 40778ES) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Next, HUVECs were loaded with MitoSOX reagent (5 \u03bcmol/L) in the dark at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009min and the staining was viewed by a confocal scanning microscope after washing. The fluorescence intensity of the HUVECs was detected with confocal microscopy (Olympus, FV3000) and quantified using Image J software.\nQuantification of endocardial complexity\nTo measure endocardial branch points, the total area covered by endocardial network and total length of the endocardial network, the transverse heart sections of E14.5 control and Gpat4 knockout embryonic hearts were stained with EMCN for visualization of endocardial networks.\nWestern blot analysis\nTissues and cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed on ice with RIPA buffer [50\u2009mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% TritonX-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% Na-deoxycholate, 1\u2009mM EDTA] containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and PhosSTOP (Roche) for 30\u2009min. Supernatant fractions were collected after centrifugation at 13,500\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C, and protein concentration was quantified by BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime, P0012). After separation via SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore), blocked in 5% non-fat milk or bovine serum albumin and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies in Table\u00a0S2. Membranes were cut and sections probed separately to reduce wastage of samples.\nQuantitative real-time PCR\nTotal RNA from cells or heart tissues was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and reversely translated into cDNA using HiScript III 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Vazyme, R312-01). Real-Time PCR was performed in MicroAmp\u2122 Optical 96-Well Reaction Plate with Barcode & Optical Caps (Applied Biosystems) using Hieff UNICON\u00ae qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (Yeasen, 11200ES). Reactions were carried out on the QuantStudio\u2122 5 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). All primers used in qRT-PCR are listed in Table\u00a0S4. Triplicate amplifications were carried out for each target gene and the housekeeping genes Actb and relative expression values were calculated using the \u0394\u0394Ct analysis method.\nCytoplasm mitochondrial DNA isolation\nHUVECs are collected and suspended using a mitochondrial isolation reagent (MCE, HY-K1060). Then, transfer the cell suspension to a glass homogenizer for homogenization. Afterwards, perform low-speed (600\u2009\u00d7\u2009g, 4\u2009\u00b0C, 10\u2009min) centrifugation to separate the nuclei, and subject the supernatant to high-speed (11,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g, 4\u00b0C, 10\u2009min) centrifugation to separate the mitochondria and cytoplasm. Finally, extract RNA from the cytoplasm and use it for reverse transcription and qPCR to assess the expression levels of mtDNA.\nRNA-seq analysis\nRNA quality was determined using the 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent) and quantified using the ND-2000 (NanoDrop Technologies). Only a highquality RNA sample (OD260/280\u2009=\u20091.8\u223c2.2, OD260/230\u2009\u2265\u20092.0, RIN\u2009\u2265\u20096.5, 28S:18S\u2009\u2265\u20091.0, >2\u2009\u03bcg) was used to construct the sequencing library. The RNAseq transcriptome library was prepared using the TruSeq\u2122 RNA sample preparation Kit from Illumina using 1\u2009\u03bcg of total RNA and sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq xten/NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009bp read length). The raw paired end reads were trimmed and quality controlled by SeqPrep and Sickle with default parameters. Then clean reads were separately aligned to reference genome with orientation mode using TopHat software. The mapping criteria of bowtie was as follows: sequencing reads should be uniquely matched to the genome allowing up to two mismatches, without insertions or deletions. The expression level of each transcript was calculated according to the fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads (FPKM) method. R statistical package software EdgeR was used for differential expression analysis.\nLC\u2013MS/MS for protein identification\nProtein immune-precipitation was performed using GPAT4 antibody in the HUVEC cells and precipitated proteins were in-gel digested by adding 1% trypsin and incubating at 37\u2009\u00b0C overnight to peptides. The AB SCIEX Zeno TOF 7600 mass spectrometer and Waters MicroLC system were used for IDA(MS) analysis. The LC gradient were prepared with Buffer A (0.1% formic acid and 2% acetonitrile in MS water) and Buffer B (0.1% formic acid and 2% water in MS acetonitrile). The analytical column is loaded with peptide samples at a concentration of 0.1\u2009\u03bcg/\u03bcL, with 4\u2009\u03bcL per sample. Separation is performed using a linear gradient from 3% to 80% Buffer B over 46\u2009min at a flow rate of 5\u2009\u03bcL/min. The column is then washed with Buffer B for 2\u2009min and re-equilibrated with 3% buffer for 7\u2009minutes. The resulting raw wiff files are subjected to ProteinPilotTM software searching, with a false discovery rate (FDR) controlled below 1%. We utilized ProteinPilotTM software for the database search of raw mass spectrometry data, employing a stringent FDR cutoff of less than 1%. Proteins identified with a minimum of two unique peptides were considered as validly identified proteins\nStatistical analysis\nAll data analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism software, version 8.0 (GraphPad Software). ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) was applied for quantification study. Statistical comparisons were carried out using the two-tailed Student\u2019s t tests. A value of P\u2009<\u20090.05 (*) was considered statistically significant; P\u2009<\u20090.01 (**), and P\u2009<\u20090.001 (***) were considered very statistically significant. ns represented no significant difference. In all the figures, measurements were reported as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. The representative data shown as IP-WB, IF staining images and Proximity/overlapping analysis were obtained from at least three independent experiments (for Figs. 3 H, K, L, 4F, H, 5 I, T).\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.",

        "TITLE": "Comparative Interactome Profiling of Nonstructural Protein 3 Across SARS-CoV-2 Variants Emerged During the COVID-19 Pandemic",
        "ABSTRACT": "SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants remain a global health threat, due to their capacity for rapid evolution. Variants throughout the COVID-19 pandemic exhibited variations in virulence, impacting vaccine protection and disease severity. Investigating nonstructural protein variants is critical to understanding viral evolution and manipulation of host protein interactions. We focus on nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), with multiple domains with different activities, including viral polyprotein cleavage, host deubiquitylation, de-ISGylation, and double-membrane vesicle formation. Using affinity purification\u2013mass spectrometry (AP-MS), we identify differential protein interactions in nsp3 caused by mutations found in variants identified between 2019 and 2024: Alpha 20I, Beta 20H, Delta 21I, Delta 21J, Gamma 20J, Kappa 21B, Lambda 21G, Omicron 21K, and Omicron 21L. A small set of amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal region of nsp3 (nsp3.1) could be traced to increased interactions with RNA-binding proteins, which are vital in viral replication. Meanwhile, variants of the central region of nsp3 (nsp3.2) were found to share interactions with protein quality control machinery, including ER-associated degradation. In this construct, shared trends in interactor enrichment are observed between Omicron 21K and Delta 21I. These results underscore how minor mutations reshape host interactions, emphasizing the evolutionary arms race between the host and virus. We provide a roadmap to track the interaction changes driven by SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution.",
        "INTRO": "1. Introduction\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a member of the Coronaviridae family, is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the progression of the pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 genome has undergone mutations that have led to changes in virulence, pathogenicity, and host immune evasion. Coronavirus genomes typically range from 26 to 32 kilobases, making them among the largest RNA virus genomes. This large genome size contributes to a high frequency of mutations and recombination events, driven by the error-prone nature of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and frequent template switching during replication. These evolutionary mechanisms enable coronaviruses to adapt to selective pressures, such as host immune defenses, while retaining functionality in the essential genes required for replication and transmission. A large part of the coronavirus genome encodes open reading frames 1a and 1b (orf1a, orf1b). These open reading frames are translated into two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which are subsequently cleaved by viral proteases into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) (Figure 1A). The nsps are subject to evolutionary pressures and undergo mutations as new variants arise. Changes in viral genomes subsequently lead to a change in protein\u2013protein interactions, even between viral strains from the same families. Such genomic plasticity likely allows SARS-CoV-2 to evolve mechanisms to escape host immune responses and improve transmissibility.\nAffinity purification\u2013mass spectrometry (AP-MS) interactome studies have showcased the patterns of virus and host protein interactions and can help elucidate the role of individual nsps. Interactome profiling of SARS-CoV-2 has allowed for (1) identification of proteins that can be targeted and repurposed for anti-viral activity and (2) provides insight into the molecular evolution of pathogenic virus strains and (3) subcellular localization of interactions. By mapping the host\u2013pathogen interaction networks, interactomics studies offer a systems-level understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying viral replication and immune evasion. These findings can contribute to developing novel therapeutic strategies by identifying key viral\u2013host interaction nodes that can be disrupted to inhibit viral replication. Here, we focus on the interactomics of the multidomain nsp3 and nine of its variants.\nFunctionally, nsp3 is essential for the viral life cycle due to its self-cleaving PL2pro protease domain that allows release from the viral polypeptide. In addition to autoproteolysis, the PL2pro domain is involved in de-ISGylation and deubiquitination. In total, nsp3 has 10 domains, and although many domain functions remain elusive, some of these domains are essential and have a significant impact on viral replication when perturbed. Nsp3 is pivotal in hijacking host cellular machinery to enhance viral replication efficiency.\nWe used AP-MS to analyze changes in nsp3 interactomics due to mutations observed in SARS-CoV-2 variants, with a specific focus on variants identified and verified by CoVariants, Nextstrain, and the World Health Organization (WHO): Omicron 21K, Omicron 21L, Lambda 21G, Kappa 21B, Delta 21I, Delta 21J, Gamma 20J, Beta 20H, and Alpha 20I. We used the reference strain Wuhan-Hu-1 (Accession MN908947) and variants surveyed starting with the Alpha variant identified in late 2020; this and subsequent variants were named by the WHO according to the Greek alphabet. The nomenclature ends with the Omicron variant that emerged in November 2021 and since then has split into various subclades (Supplementary Figure S1). We find that the Omicron nsp3 variants show the most distinct interactomes while most other interactors between variants and the Wuhan reference strain are shared. These interactome changes imply that Omicron-specific mutations could play a role in enhancing host adaptation and immune evasion. Our rich proteomics dataset provides insights into the evolution of nonstructural protein variants and the susceptibility of viral evolutionary adaptations, as these may impact infection rates and disease severity. Relatively small perturbation to protein coding sequences, like single and double point mutations, can alter interactomes and impact manipulations of host machinery.",
        "RESULTS": "3. Results\n3.1. Selection and Expression of Variants\nSARS-CoV-2 variants of concern were analyzed to determine variants with mutations to nsp3 that could be considered for this study. We divided nsp3 into three fragments based on previous work: nsp3.1 (amino acids 1\u2013749), nsp3.2 (aa 750\u20131462), and nsp3.3 (aa 1463\u20131945) (Figure 1B). At the time of surveying variants, the majority of nsp3 mutations were in the nsp3.1\u20133.2 region, while mutations in nsp3.3 were scarce, so we excluded nsp3.3 from this study to enhance comparative power for the first two truncations. The following variants within nsp3.1 and nsp3.2 were selected, with the corresponding Pango lineages in parentheses: Omicron 21K (BA.1), Omicron 21L (BA.2), Delta 21J (no Pango lineage), Alpha 20I (B.1.1.7), Beta 20H (B.1.351), Gamma 20J (P.1), Lambda 21G(C.37), and Kappa 21B (B.1.617.1). These lineages feature eight point mutations in nsp3.1 and seven mutations in nsp3.2 (Figure 1C).\nThis study examines mutations across multiple domains of nsp3. In nsp3.1, they are in the ubiquitin-like domain (Ubl1), SARS-unique domain (SUD), and the macrodomain (Mac1) (Figure 1C). The Ubl1 domain has core residues that fold into a ubiquitin-like structure with disjointed helices that binds single-stranded RNA and interacts with the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The Mac1 domain has been shown to combat host immune response and binds and hydrolyzes ADP-ribose and poly(ADP-ribose), which serve as a post-translational modifications. We also observed mutations in the SUD domain, which can bind RNA, impacts viral replication, and helps with evading host immune responses.\nIn nsp3.2, mutations occur in the papain-like protease domain (PL2Pro) and betacoronavirus-specific marker (\u03b2SM) region (Figure 1C). The analysis includes five variants with six total mutations. This central fragment of nsp3 is inserted into the ER membrane and contains six domains (Figure 1C). Additionally, the transmembrane domains of nsp3.2 contribute to the stability and structural integrity of the replication organelles, mediating interactions between viral and host membranes to ensure proper compartmentalization of the replication complex. The PL2Pro domain functions to cleave nsp1, nsp2, nsp3, and nsp4 from the polyprotein and has deubiquitinating and de-ISGylation activity. The second region with nsp3.2 mutations, \u03b2SM, is intrinsically disordered and has an unknown function. Interestingly, the domains SUD (nsp3.1) and the PL2Pro (nsp3.2) have the highest frequency of mutation events, and no mutations were identified in the Mac1 domain. Four out of the five variants exhibited mutations in the papain-like protease (PL2Pro) domain.\nAll variant constructs have a C-terminal FLAG tag for immunoprecipitations. Mutations were confirmed through sequencing, and all showed comparable levels of protein expression (Figure 1D). Although a lung-derived cell line would be a more physiologically relevant model, previous studies have shown HEK293T cells as a suitable model for recapitulating viral protein interactions with host factors.\n3.2. AP-MS of nsp3 Mutations\nHost protein interactions with nsp3 were assessed by expressing the variant constructs, lysing the cells, and performing co-immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-FLAG beads (Figure 1D). Elution samples from immunoprecipitations were reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin/Lys-C. Peptides were labeled using TMTpro 16plex reagents for MS2-based relative quantification. For each construct, between three and four biological replicates were pooled into a TMTpro 16plex run. Mock IPs from cells transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) were also included to assess the background abundance of proteins during the Co-IP process. In total, five TMTpro 16plex nsp3.1 sets were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry with 8\u201312 biological replicates per variant, and five TMTpro 16plex nsp3.2 sets were analyzed with 9\u201310 biological replicates per variant. Proteome Discoverer 2.4 was used to identify and quantify nsp3 interactors based on the relative TMTpro reporter ion signals. High-confidence interactors were identified by using a variable cutoff method based on enrichment with a GFP background control (Supplementary Figure S2).\n3.3. Comparison of nsp3.1 Interactors\nThe comparative proteomics dataset for the cytosolic and N-terminal section of SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 (nsp3.1) includes seven variant constructs for a total of eight point mutations. Variant Omicron 21L contains two mutations within the fragment, and the following variants contain single mutations: Omicron 21K, Delta 21J, Alpha 21I, Gamma 20J, Lambda, and Kappa (Figure 1C).\nThe nsp3.1 dataset is made up of five mass spectrometry runs. High-confidence interactors were filtered for the Wuhan reference strain nsp3.1 construct and variants by considering their fold enrichment and adjusted p-value. We identified 411 SARS-CoV-2 nsp3.1 high-confidence interactors and 300\u2013400 interactors per variant (Supplementary Dataset S1 and S2). The interactors of the nsp3.1 reference and variant strains show mitochondrion, nucleus, and cytoplasm as the top three compartment localizations using SubcellulaRVis (Supplementary Dataset S3). We identified 104 shared protein interactors with all eight constructs (Figure 2). Gene ontology assignments through Enrichr were used to map biological processes and molecular functions represented in the list of proteins. RNA-binding proteins are the largest cluster identified in the dataset and include members of the Fragile X-related gene family (FMRPs), FMR1, FXR1, and FXR2 (Figure 2). This family of proteins is highly homologous with structural and functional similarities, only varying in the C-terminal region.\nIn addition, other shared interactors for the nsp3.1 variants clustered into a smaller subpopulation. Some of these groups include proteins involved in mitochondrial organization (AGK, TAMM41, TIMM23, YME1L1, TIMMDC1, RPL23, and ATAD3A), mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (SLC25A5, SLC35F6, SLC25A4, and SLC25A6), and cellular respiration (SLC25A13, NDUFA6, NDUFB10, and OXA1L). Other groupings include microtubule-associated proteins (MAP7D3, KIF2A, TUBA4A, TUBB4B, MAP4, TUBA1A, and KATNB1) and ubiquitin ligase binding (CUL2, HSPA8, RBX1, DNAJA1, and FAF2).\nWhile there were many shared interactors, each construct had its own set of high-confidence interactors (Figure 2). Although the proteins identified are unique to the constructs, the most commonly identified grouping is RNA binding. Under this category, the Wuhan reference strain interacts with RPS7 and LRPPRC, and variant Gamma 20J interacts with DYRK1A, DAPK3, HOXA9, ATF3, SIN3A, GATAD2A, HCFC1, ELOC, KMT2E, ZEB2, ELOA, SGF29, and FOXC1. Similarly, variant Lambda 21G has three proteins (TCERG1, NOL9, and FASTKD1) categorized under RNA processing. Omicron constructs also have interactors identified as RNA-binding proteins, in total 17 proteins for Omicron 21K and 12 proteins for Omicron 21L. A few variants had high-confidence interactors that represented other categories, such as Gamma 20J with DNA-templated transcription proteins (PDS5A, EME1, POLH, NSMCE4A, and XPA), Lambda 21G with amino acid transport (SLC7A5, SLC1A5, SFXN1, and SLC16A10), and Omicron 21K with kinase-binding proteins (PIP5K1A, TPX2, GOLGA2, AXIN1, TOLLIP, and PPP1CB).\nIn total, 871 proteins were identified as high-confidence interactors in at least one of the constructs surveyed. The abundance levels of these proteins were assessed across all constructs, and hierarchical clustering was used to sort the proteins based on enrichment patterns (Supplementary Figure S3, Supplementary Dataset S4). Clusters were then filtered using Enrichr to identify biological processes and molecular functions identified in each cluster. Cluster 1 is the largest cluster and has a total of 474 proteins with 103 involved in RNA binding and 28 identified as being involved in gene expression (Supplementary Dataset S4). Cluster 5 is made up of 44 proteins which show enrichment in all constructs, except for Omicron 21K and Omicron 21L (Figure 3A). Of the proteins in cluster 5, three are involved in the regulation of nuclear division and four in ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis (Figure 3B). Interestingly, clusters 6 and 7 are made up of two proteins each and were found to have increased enrichment for Omicron 21K, Omicron 21L, and Gamma 20J (Figure 3C). These four proteins are ELOB, DUS3L, MARK4, and THAP4 and have no shared GO terms.\nThe comparative proteomics of the N-terminal section of nsp3 (nsp3.1) resulted in 871 high-confidence protein interactors across seven constructs. A core set of 104 shared interactors was identified, with RNA-binding proteins forming the largest functional cluster. Unique interactors were identified for each variant, with the highest number found in Omicron 21K, Omicron 21L, and Gamma 20J. The number of unique interactors highlights potential variant-specific functional adaptations.\n3.4. Comparison of nsp3.2 Interactors\nThe dataset for this fragment consists of 5 mass spectrometry runs with 10 replicates each for Alpha 20I, Delta 21I, and Omicron 21K variants and 9 replicates for Beta 20H and Gamma 20J. We identified 153 high-confidence interactors for the Wuhan reference strain fragment and 100\u2013400 high-confidence interactors for variant constructs (Supplementary Dataset S2). Using SubcellulaRVis, we identified the top two cellular compartments to be the cytosol and the ER, as expected due to the cytosolic and ER membrane-bound portion of the fragment (Supplementary Dataset S3). Notably, some proteins were identified as high-confidence interactors across all constructs in this survey of variants (Figure 4). These shared interactors include proteins related to broader protein quality control pathways, including glycosylation regulation and degradation (MLEC, LMAN1, BAG2, LAMP1, CANX, RNF5, and CLGN).\nEach construct was also found to have distinct high-confidence interactors absent from other constructs (Figure 4). For instance, the Omicron 21K variant construct had more unique high-confidence interactors than other constructs. The group of interactors includes proteins involved in degradation pathways (PLK1, ECPAS, DERL1, BAG5, FAF2, UBXN8, MAD2L1, and DCUN1D5), phosphotransferase activity (DCAKD, PANK4, NT5C3A, ADPGK, and AGK), cellular respiration (UQCRC2, NDUFA4, NDUFA9, MTFR2, NDUFS3, COX15, and SLC25A13), and 22 protein transport factors. The largest subset of Omicron 21K consisted of RNA-binding proteins, with a total of 29 proteins. Similarly, this category is not unique to a single construct, as there is a subpopulation of RNA-binding proteins in the Delta 21I variant (CHERP, SF3B1, EXOSC7, PYM1, SMNDC1, U2SURP, and CCDC86). The Alpha 20I variant bound factors are involved in GTP binding (RAB32, TUBB4A, and TUBB4B) and protein stabilization (RPAP3, GET1, and P3H1).\nAcross all constructs, 673 high-confidence interactors were identified. These were categorized into five clusters based on enrichment patterns (Supplementary Figure S4, Supplementary Dataset S5). Cluster 2 included 314 proteins with increased enrichment in Delta 21I and Omicron 21K constructs compared to the reference strain (Figure 5A). Much like the previously discussed nsp3.1 fragment, the major subpopulation of proteins is classified as RNA binding (Figure 5B). Cluster 3 maintained interactions with the Delta 21I and Omicron 21K variants, while Gamma 20J, Alpha 20I, and Beta 20H showed severely diminished interactions compared to the Wuhan reference strain nsp3.1 (Figure 5C). Proteins in cluster 3 are involved in the glycerophospholipid biosynthesis process (CEPT1 and AGPAT3), a pathway that facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication by enabling formation of double-membrane vesicles.\nIn contrast, clusters 4 and 5 showed increased enrichment in three constructs, excluding Omicron 21K and Delta 21I. Cluster 4 includes proteins associated with ERAD (TOR1A and UGGT1) (Figure 5D), while cluster 5 contains proteins implicated in extracellular remodeling and stress fiber assembly (PLOD3, TGFBR1, and FERMT2) (Figure 5E). Notably, extracellular matrix remodeling and stress fiber formation are critical for forming virus-loaded vesicles and have been observed in clinical COVID-19 cases and molecular models.\nTo summarize, the comparative proteomics analysis of nsp3.2 identified shared interactors for five variants related to protein quality control, and clustering revealed variant-specific enrichment in RNA processing, calcium transport, lipid biosynthesis, and extracellular remodeling, suggesting functional adaptations.",
        "DISCUSS": "4. Discussion\nGenetic variation in viral genomes has profound impacts on both viral and host processes, including viral identity and evolution, formation of new variants or strains, pathogenesis, host immune response, and drug resistance. A significant concern with SARS-CoV-2 arises from the high mutation rate of RNA viruses, which contributes to changes in pathogenicity and transmissibility. Comparative interactomics of nsp3 variants has enabled the identification of host proteins and pathways that may be altered due to changes in the viral genome. In this work, we use quantitative proteomics to identify changes in host protein\u2013protein interactions based on nsp3 variants: Omicron 21K and 21L, Lambda 21G, Kappa 21B, Delta 21I and J, Gamma 20J, Beta 20H, and Alpha 20I. In December of 2020, the first variant was declared and later renamed Alpha 20I, with the emergence of Gamma, Beta, and Delta subsequently following. The variants coexisted and COVID-19 infection continued at different rates depending on geographical regions and infections in subpopulations. Delta became the next dominant subclade as reports of the frequency of Alpha, Beta, and Gamma diminished. Ultimately, the Omicron variant was identified and coexisted with Delta, until it became the leading variant. Since the time of our study, the Omicron 21L variant has given rise to new subclades, and novel variants continue to emerge. These evolutionary adaptations can enable immune evasion and reduce vaccine efficacy, underscoring the importance of investigating variant-driven changes in virulence.\nOur findings reveal that mutations in nsp3 variants tend to cluster within specific domains rather than being uniformly distributed across the protein. Notably, none of our selected variants harbored mutations in the Mac1 domain, a key region involved in counteracting the host immune response and supporting viral replication. The absence of mutations in this domain may highlight its essential role in viral fitness. Previous studies have demonstrated that mutations and deletions of the Mac1 domain have resulted in reduced catalytic activity and viral loads and increased interferon response in both SARS-CoV-2 and murine hepatitis virus (MHV). In contrast, the PL2pro domain emerged as the most frequently mutated in our analysis. As one of two proteases in the viral genome, PL2pro is critical for cleaving viral polyproteins to release individual nonstructural proteins and possesses deubiquitinating and de-ISGylating activities. Its essential role in viral replication and immune modulation makes it an attractive anti-viral target. Based on a published structure of the SARS-CoV-2 PL2pro domain, the catalytic region does not seem to be impacted by variant mutations, which may be indicative of viral protein immune evasion in enzymatic regions (Supplementary Figure S5). Previous studies have investigated the impact of nonstructural protein variants on phosphorylation, yet it would be beneficial to expand this into variant changes in ISGylation and ubiquitination to assess pro- or anti-viral changes.\nFragment nsp3.1, which lacks a transmembrane region, localizes to the cytosol, while nsp3.2 is inserted into the ER membrane. The differences in localization allow us to validate some of our findings; for example, we identify cytosolic proteins with the enrichment of nsp3.1, whereas enrichment on nsp3.2 results in ER-related proteins involved in protein quality control (Supplementary Dataset S3).\nConsistent with previous findings that identified RNA-binding proteins as interactors of nsp3 in SARS-CoV-2 and less pathogenic coronaviruses, our results further indicate that variant nsp3 constructs exhibit an increased abundance of RNA-binding proteins compared to Wuhan reference strain SARS-CoV-2. Given the central role of RNA in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, both as the viral genome and through its interaction with host processes, RNA-binding proteins likely contribute to viral replication, transcription, immune evasion, and host pathway modulation. A previous study has shown that RNA transcripts and proteins have the strongest response to variant infection compared to the reference strain. The role of nsp3 for the formation of double-membrane vesicles serves as a protective mechanism for viral replication. Additionally, viruses may generate membrane-less compartments through liquid\u2013liquid phase separation as protective compartments for viral replication. RNA-binding proteins are key players in the formation of phase-separated membrane-less organelles, including in viral infection settings. Existing data suggest that interactions between the nucleocapsid (N) protein and nsp3 can regulate separation. This may be indicative of the importance of host RNA-binding proteins in helping mediate the viral-driven hijacking of the cell, and the increased abundance of RNA-binding proteins in nsp3 variants may suggest an increased dependence on biomolecular condensates.\nWe found prominent interactions between nsp3.1 and members of the Fragile X-related protein family (FMRPs), FMR1, FXR1, and FXR2. In recent work, it was found that there is a direct interaction between the FMRPs and nsp3 through a peptide motif. Disruption of the interaction between FMRPs and nsp3 leads to reduced viral replication, making the interaction between these proteins pro-viral. The interaction between nsp3 and FMRPs has been observed in previous studies of the nsp3 Wuhan reference strain and some variants, yet here we show that this interaction occurs with a wide spectrum of variant forms of nsp3. The identification of FMRPs as high-confidence interactors in all constructs of nsp3 can serve as supporting evidence of the importance of this interaction for viral replication. The FMRPs are part of the RNA-binding protein group that we identified in our interactions. In the future, we aim to assess if other interactors found in our dataset could be implicated in the formation of stress granules, a type of membrane-less organelle. We are particularly interested in investigating if interactions with DIMT1, a methyltransferase, are conserved during viral infection and in biologically relevant cell lines. DIMT1 is part of the intracellular membrane-less organelle gene ontology category, which includes FMRPs, but has yet to be directly implicated in stress granule formation during viral infection. DIMT1 is an intriguing hit because another methyltransferase, protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), has been identified within stress granules and shown to promote stress granule assembly.\nWithin the nsp3.2 dataset, we identified malectin (MLEC) as a high-confidence interactor for the Wuhan reference strain and its variants. Previous proteomics studies have implicated MLEC as an interactor of SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural proteins, specifically nsp2. The glycoprotein quality control factor, MLEC, may be implicated in increased replication for SARS-CoV-2 and murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a well-established infection model.\nClinical observations have linked Delta variant infections to increased disease severity and prolonged viral shedding, while Omicron infections are associated with milder disease but higher viral shedding compared to Delta. Our findings show notable differences between Omicron and Delta variant interactors that are most drastic in the nsp3.1 dataset. While nsp3.1 interactomes for Omicron and Delta diverged significantly, nsp3.2 variants showed similar interaction patterns, clustering Omicron 21K and Delta 21I. This indicates that Omicron and Delta variant mutations in nsp3.1 led to a divergence in interaction patterns, whereas the interactomes with nsp3.2 variants are similar. Although our study provides valuable insights, it faces certain limitations. The lack of biological context, the remodeling that occurs during viral infection, and the use of the HEK293T cell line as a model (rather than the primary epithelial lung cells that are the main infection site for SARS-CoV-2) mean that not all the interactions identified in this study may be directly relevant to the viral infection process. This highlights the importance of studying nsp3 in its full form and during viral infection, as it allows for a more comprehensive aggregation of data, which can subsequently facilitate more accurate conclusions regarding the predominant interactions.\nIn total, we investigated the protein interactome across nsp3 variants, specifically focusing on the fragments nsp3.1 and nsp3.2. Our dataset represents the most variant-diverse nsp3 interactome to date with a total of 9 variants and 15 mutations. The study of nonstructural protein variants offers critical insights into their functional diversity, evolutionary adaptations, and roles in pathogenicity. By elucidating key structure\u2013function relationships, mechanisms of drug resistance, and host\u2013pathogen interactions, these findings provide a foundation for developing broad-spectrum therapeutics and improving our understanding of disease progression at a molecular level. These findings can inform the development of broad-spectrum therapeutics and enhance our ability to predict disease outcomes and design effective interventions. The comparative analysis provided here can also be utilized to gain insight into possible functions of domains of nsp3 that remain unknown. By comparing the variants with mutations in similar regions, we can gain insight into interactors that are conserved or altered due to genetic changes. The Omicron 21L variant continues to evolve and generate sublineages that dominate SARS-CoV-2 evolution, as opposed to the emergence of new variants (Supplementary Figure S1). This led the WHO to supplement the variants of concern (VOCs) list to include VOC lineages under monitoring (VOC-LUM). These new sublineages maintain the mutations found in their ancestor and have additional mutations that can impact viral properties. All Omicron VOC-LUM have ancestral Omicron 21L mutations, and 16 out of 17 have additional mutations in nsp3. Future interactome studies of viral variants would continue to increase our understanding of mutations that lead to divergent molecular mechanisms or have an impact on virulence, particularly in an infection setting.\nDisclaimer/Publisher\u2019s Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

        "METHODS": "2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Construct Design\nWuhan reference strain constructs of nsp3.1 and nsp3.2 were created and validated in previous publications and correspond to predicted SARS-CoV domains. A previous publication from our lab has shown proper localization of fragment nsp3.1 to the cytosol and nsp3.2 localization to the ER. Variant constructs were identified using Nexstrain, CoVariants, and the World Health Organization (WHO). Variant mutations identified and mapped were then mutated on the reference strain construct using a QuikChange Lightning (and Multi) Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent). Constructs were confirmed by sequencing.\n2.2. Cell Culture and Transfection\nHEK293T cells were grown using Dulbeccos\u2019 Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% glutamine. Cell cultures were maintained at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Cells in 10 cm dishes were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate method with 5ug nsp3.1, nsp3.2, or GFP plasmid DNA. Medium was replenished after 16 h, and cells were harvested 24 h after that by scrapping on ice.\n2.3. FLAG IPs\nImmunoprecipitations were carried out as previously described. Cell pellets were lysed using TNI buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% IGEPAL-CA-630) with \u201ccOmplete\u201d protease inhibitor (Roche). Lysis was performed for a minimum of 10 min on ice and a 10 min sonication in room temperature water bath. After centrifugation at 21,100\u00d7 g for 20 min, the lysate was collected, and protein concentrations were normalized using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Normalized lysates were combined with 15 \u00b5L Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma) and rocked at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 400\u00d7 g for 10 min, the supernatant was combined with 15 \u00b5L G1 anti-DYKDDDDK resin (GenScript) and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C while rocking. The resin was centrifugated at 400\u00d7 g for 10 min and washed 4\u00d7 with TNI lysis buffer. Proteins bound to the resin were eluted with 6% SDS and 62.5 mM Tris for 30 min at room temperature and 15 min at 37 \u00b0C, followed by a second elution for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C.\n2.4. Sample Preparation for TMT Label\nFive individual runs were used for analysis of nsp3.1 and nsp3.2 variant interactomes. In total, 80 IP samples were distributed across the 5 mass spectrometry runs for nsp3.1: 11\u00d7 GFP (IP negative control), 11\u00d7 nsp3.1 (IP Wuhan reference strain control), 8\u00d7 Omicron 21K, 8\u00d7 Omicron 21L, 8\u00d7 Lambda 21G, 7\u00d7 Kappa 21B, 7\u00d7 Delta 21J, 12\u00d7 Gamma 20J, and 8\u00d7 Alpha 20I. While 80 IPs were performed for nsp3.2, 6 were omitted because mutation P1228L was not found to relate to a variant mutation. The IP sample replicates were as follows: 13\u00d7 GFP, 13\u00d7 nsp3.2, 10\u00d7 Omicron 21K, 10\u00d7 Delta 21I, 9\u00d7 Gamma 20J, 9\u00d7 Beta 20H, 10\u00d7 Alpha 20I, and 6\u00d7 P1228L.\nEluted proteins were precipitated with a methanol/chloroform/water (3:1:3) method and washed 3\u00d7 with methanol. Pellets were air-dried before resuspending with 1% Rapigest SF (Waters). Proteins were reduced using TCEP for 30 min and alkylated with iodoacetamide for 30 min before digesting with 0.5 \u03bcg trypsin/Lys-C (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA) overnight at 37 \u00b0C with agitation. TMTpro 16plex (Thermo) was used to label digested peptides and quenched with ammonium bicarbonate. Samples were pooled, acidified, and concentrated before removing cleaved Rapigest products by centrifugation for 45 min at 17,000\u00d7 g.\n2.5. MudPIT LC-MS/MS Analysis\nMudPIT columns were prepared as described previously, in triphasic layers of 1.5 cm C18/SCX/C18 resins. TMT-labeled samples were loaded onto the columns using a high-pressure chamber and washed with buffer A (95% water, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) for 30 min. Online fractionation by liquid chromatography was carried out using an Ultimate 3000 nanoLC and analyzed using an Exploris480 mass spectrometer (Thermo). Sequential injections of 10 \u03bcL were carried out for 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% buffer C (500 mM ammonium acetate, 94.9% water, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid v/v) with a final injection of 90% buffer C and 10% buffer B (99.9% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid v/v). Each injection had a 130 min gradient with a flow rate of 500 nl/min (0\u20136 min: 2% buffer B; 8 min: 5% B; 100 min: 35% B; 105 min: 65% B; 106\u2013113 min: 85% B; 113\u2013130 min: 2% B). ESI was performed from the tip of the microcapillary column using 2.2 kV for spray voltage, 275 \u00b0C for the ion transfer tube, and RF lens of 40%. A scan range of 400 to 1600 m/z, 120k resolution, AGC target 300%, and automatic injection times were used for the collection of MS1 spectra. MS2 spectra were gathered in a data-dependent mode using a monoisotopic peak selection: peptide, including charge state 2 to 7, TopSpeed method (3 s cycle time), isolation window 0.4 m/z, HCD fragmentation using a normalized collision energy of 32 (TMTpro), resolution 45k, AGC target of 200%, and dynamic exclusion (20 ppm window) for 60 s. Proteome Discoverer 2.4 (Thermo) was used for the identification and quantification of peptides. Fragment sequences for nsp3 were used in addition to the SwissProt human database. Searches used Sequest HT: trypsin cleavage (maximum two missed cleavages), minimum peptide length of 6 AAs, precursor mass tolerance of 20 ppm, fragment mass tolerance of 0.02 Da, dynamic modifications of Met oxidation (+15.995 Da), protein N-terminal Met loss (\u2212131.040 Da), and protein N-terminal acetylation (+42.011 Da), static modifications of TMTpro (+304.207 Da) at Lys, and N-termini and Cys carbamidomethylation (+57.021 Da). Quantification of TMT reporter ions was performed with unique and razor peptides and excluding proteins with co-isolation interference > 25%. After the search, results were filtered to include only proteins with at least two identified peptides. Protein identification and quantification are included in Supplementary Dataset S1. Code used for data analysis can be found at  (Accessed on 28 February 2025).\n2.6. Geneset Enrichment Analysis, Network Plots, and Comparative Heatmaps\nBiological processes of high-confidence interactors were assessed using gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis through Enrichr. Redundant GO terms were grouped manually based on overlapping terms, where appropriate. Network plots were generated using Cytoscape 3.10.3. Heatmaps were generated using R package pheatmap, after protein abundances were normalized to bait nsp3 levels.",

        "TITLE": "Endosomal chloride/proton exchangers need inhibitory TMEM9 \u03b2-subunits for regulation and prevention of disease-causing overactivity",
        "ABSTRACT": "The function of endosomes critically depends on their ion homeostasis. A crucial role of luminal Cl\u2212, in addition to that of H+, is increasingly recognized. Both ions are transported by five distinct endolysosomal CLC chloride/proton exchangers. Dysfunction of each of these transporters entails severe disease. Here we identified TMEM9 and TMEM9B as obligatory \u03b2-subunits for endosomal ClC-3, ClC-4, and ClC-5. Mice lacking both \u03b2-subunits displayed severely reduced levels of all three CLCs and died embryonically or shortly after birth. TMEM9 proteins regulate trafficking of their partners. Surprisingly, they also strongly inhibit CLC ion transport. Tonic inhibition enables the regulation of CLCs and prevents toxic Cl\u2212 accumulation and swelling of endosomes. Inhibition requires a carboxy-terminal TMEM9 domain that interacts with CLCs at multiple sites. Disease-causing CLCN mutations that weaken inhibition by TMEM9 proteins cause a pathogenic gain of ion transport. Our work reveals the need to suppress, in a regulated manner, endolysosomal chloride/proton exchange. Several aspects of endosomal ion transport must be revised.\nEndosomal function depends on luminal ion homeostasis. Here the authors identify TMEM9 and TMEM9B as inhibitory subunits of endosomal ClC-3 to ClC\u22125 that prevent endosomal swelling and disease by regulating their Cl\u2212/H+ exchange and trafficking.",
        "INTRO": "Introduction\nThe function and trafficking of endosomes and lysosomes critically depends on ion transport across their membranes. Most work on endosomal ion homeostasis has focused on luminal pH, but other ions, such as Cl\u2212 also play pivotal roles. Traditional thinking focused on an indirect role of electrogenic Cl\u2212 transport in facilitating luminal acidification by shunting currents of H+ ATPases. More recent data point to an important role of luminal Cl\u2212 concentration which influences vesicular volume and the activity of luminal enzymes. Major players in endosomal Cl\u2212 transport are CLC chloride/proton exchangers. The importance of endolysosomal ion transport is evident from pathologies associated with their dysfunction. With CLC 2Cl\u2212/H+ exchangers, these include neurodegenerative syndromes, lysosomal storage, osteopetrosis and albinism, and proteinuria and kidney stones.\nThe CLC family of Cl\u2212 channels and transporters comprises nine members. Members of the first homology branch, ClC-1, -2, -Ka, and -Kb, function as Cl\u2212 channels at the plasma membrane. Members of the second (ClC-3 to ClC-5) and third branches (ClC-6 and ClC-7) function as 2Cl\u2212/H+-exchangers on intracellular vesicles (hence vCLCs). ClC-3 to ClC-6 are found in overlapping endosomal compartments, whereas ClC-7 is mainly expressed on lysosomes. vCLCs function in endolysosomal Cl\u2212 accumulation and acidification. Although all vCLCs are 2Cl\u2212/H+-exchangers and share, with the exception of ClC-6, similar voltage- and pH-dependencies, the pathologies associated with their dysfunction differ. This might be explained by different expression patterns or regulation.\nCLCs operate as dimers with one ion translocation pathway per subunit. All CLCs function as homodimers, but heterodimers within the same homology branch are possible. Several CLC proteins bind ancillary \u201c\u03b2-subunits\u201d. Barttin and Ostm1 are obligatory \u03b2-subunits for ClC-K channels and ClC-7 exchangers, respectively, and GlialCam is a facultative \u03b2-subunit of ClC-2. However, the mechanisms by which they regulate the function of their CLC partners are obscure. It has remained unknown whether ClC-3 to ClC-6 have \u03b2-subunits.\nHere we show that endosomal ClC-3, ClC-4, and ClC-5 require TMEM9 and TMEM9B for normal function and protein stability. These obligatory \u03b2-subunits regulate both the trafficking and ion transport of their CLC partners via distinct carboxy-terminal domains. Strong constitutive suppression of Cl\u2212/H+ exchange by TMEM9/9B allows to\u00a0markedly increase ion transport even with minor relaxation of this inhibition. Human CLCN mutations interfering with this control lead to toxic gain of endosomal ion transport and disease.",

The resulting abundance-mass profiles reflected functional homo/hetero-dimeric assemblies (profile-peaks at \u223c400\u2009kDa), as well as incompletely assembled CLC monomers (\u223c200\u2009kDa). Our data uncovered perfect overlap, indicative for co-assembly, of the ClC-3/-4 profiles with those of TMEM9 and TMEM9B, type I transmembrane proteins of \u223c20\u2009kDa. A similar overlap was detected with ClC-5 which is poorly expressed in brain.\nMulti-epitope affinity-purifications from mouse brain combined with mass spectrometry (meAP-MS) confirmed effective co-assembly of the TMEM9 proteins with ClC-3 to -5, indicated by their tight co-clustering in two-dimensional t-SNE plots (Fig.\u00a01b,c). The MS-derived abundance and ratio data indicated specific and stoichiometric co-assembly of ClC-3 to -5 with TMEM9 and TMEM9B.\nTMEM9 and TMEM9B are \u223c56% identical. Orthologs are present in probably all animals, with mammals having two isoforms (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). TMEM9 proteins display a cleavable signal peptide, a glycosylated amino-terminus, a single transmembrane span, and a cytosolic carboxy-terminus of \u224870 residues. Both TMEM9 (referred to as TMEM9A or T9A) and TMEM9B (T9B) were reported to reside in lysosomes and late endosomes and to have functions in cellular signaling and cancer.\nT9A co-immunoprecipitated two different ClC-3 splice variants, ClC-4 and ClC-5, but not ClC-7, from lysates of transfected cells (Fig.\u00a01d). To determine which parts of T9 proteins interact with CLCs, we constructed chimeras with Ostm1, the ClC-7 \u03b2-subunit which shares the same transmembrane topology. Co-immunoprecipitations revealed that the transmembrane domain (TMD) of T9A was necessary to bind ClC-5 (Fig.\u00a01e). Expression databases (www.proteinatlas.org/) indicate almost ubiquitous expression of T9A and T9B transcripts. Western blots confirmed wide-spread expression of either protein while revealing differences in expression levels (Fig.\u00a02a). Together with the differential distribution of their CLC partners, this suggests that ratios of particular CLC/T9 complexes vary between tissues.\nWe disrupted both Tmem9 genes singly and in combination in mice. Both Tmem9\u2212/\u2212 (T9a\u2212/\u2212) and Tmem9b\u2212/\u2212 (T9b\u2212/\u2212) mice lacked obvious phenotypes. For T9a\u2212/\u2212 mice, this agrees with previous work, while T9b\u2212/\u2212 mice have not yet been reported. Crossing both strains failed to generate live T9a\u2212/\u2212/T9b\u2212/\u2212 offspring in >30 litters, with lethality of double KO mice occurring after E12.5 (see Methods). Hence T9 proteins have crucial physiological functions. Both isoforms may partially replace each other.\nMutual dependence of CLC and T9 proteins\nAlthough T9a or T9b disruption did not change transcript levels of Clcn3 \u2013 Clcn5 or T9b and T9a, respectively (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02), T9A protein levels were upregulated upon loss of T9B (Fig.\u00a02b). Reciprocal dependencies of CLC and T9 protein levels were analyzed in brain, which abundantly expresses ClC-3 and ClC-4, and in kidney, the main site of ClC-5 expression. As T9a\u2212/\u2212/T9b\u2212/\u2212 mice were not viable, we examined tissues from single KOs or from mice homozygous for disruption of one isoform and heterozygous for the other (Fig.\u00a02b). Loss of T9 subunits differentially affected levels of their CLC partners. Most striking was the strong decrease of ClC-4 with loss of either T9A or T9B in kidney. Renal expression of ClC-5 was dependent on T9B, but not on T9A. By contrast, levels of ClC-3 and of the non-interacting ClC-6 or ClC-7 exchangers appeared unchanged. Cultured fibroblasts derived from T9a\u2212/\u2212/T9b\u2212/\u2212 embryos had almost completely lost ClC-3, -4 and -5 proteins (Fig.\u00a02c). The abundance of ClC-7 and several endolysosomal marker proteins was unchanged.\nConversely, T9 proteins depend on CLCs for stability (Fig.\u00a02d-f). Most prominent was the massive reduction of T9A protein in Clcn3\u2212/\u2212 brain. It may be explained by the concomitant reduction of ClC-4, which is observed in brain and other tissues of Clcn3\u2212/\u2212 mice, and by low ClC-5 levels in brain. This leaves only small amounts of CLC partners for T9A stabilization. T9B was unchanged in Clcn3\u2212/\u2212 kidney and only moderately reduced in brain. T9A levels also depended on ClC-4 and ClC-5 (Fig.\u00a02e,f). T9B lost its glycosylation in Clcn5\u2212/\u2212 kidney (Fig.\u00a02f), suggesting that it may not reach the Golgi without ClC-5. Accordingly, disruption of Clcn5 abolished T9A and T9B expression in apical endosomes of renal proximal tubules where these proteins normally co-localize (Fig.\u00a02g,h). T9B appeared non-glycosylated in brain which almost lacks ClC-5 (Fig.\u00a02d,e). The proportion of glycosylated T9B seemed increased in Clcn3\u2212/\u2212 kidney (Fig.\u00a02d), where ClC-3 and ClC-4 now compete less with ClC-5 for T9B binding. Preferential ClC-5/T9B interaction was further supported by the observation that loss of T9B, but not of T9A, reduced ClC-5 amounts in kidney (Fig.\u00a02b).\nPredominant endosomal localization of T9A and T9B\nAs binding partners of endosomal ClC-3, -4 and -5, T9A and T9B should localize to the same compartments as their CLC partners. Antibodies against C-terminal epitopes of either T9 isoform gave punctate cytoplasmic staining in HeLa cells which only sparsely co-localized with early endosomal rab5 or late endosomal and lysosomal lamp2 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a,b). The sparse co-localization might be owed, in part, to a shielding of T9 epitopes in CLC/T9 complexes (see below). Transfection of the rab5 mutant Q79L enlarges endosomal compartments to which we had previously localized ClC-5. Endogenous T9A and T9B were found on these structures (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03c).\nThe endocytic apparatus of renal proximal tubules is conveniently stratified. Both T9A and T9B were detected in a subapical, endosome-enriched rim which prominently expresses ClC-5 (Fig.\u00a02g,h). No significant co-localization was observed with late endosomal/lysosomal ClC-7 or lamp1 (Fig.\u00a02i). Bone marrow-derived macrophages showed unambiguous co-localization of T9B and ClC-5 on large macropinosomes (Fig.\u00a02j).\nLocalization of T9A and T9B to endosomes agrees with their role as \u03b2-subunits of ClC-3 to ClC-5. However, others have described T9A and T9B as localizing predominantly to lysosomes. T9A had been reported to bind lysosomal H+-ATPases and help with their assembly. Non-ratiometric Lysotracker\u00ae staining had suggested a markedly less acidic lysosomal pH (pHlys) in T9A\u2212/\u2212 cells. However, we observed no differences in Lysotracker\u00ae or Lysosensor\u00ae labeling in HeLa cells or mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and pHlys was undistinguishable between WT, T9A\u2212/\u2212 and T9A\u2212/\u2212/T9B\u2212/\u2212 HeLa cells in ratiometric measurements (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03d-f). Neither complexome profiling nor affinity-purification of T9 complexes (Fig.\u00a01a-c) hinted at an association of T9 with V-type-ATPases.\nTMEM9 proteins regulate vCLC traffic via an acidic cluster\nTo investigate whether T9 proteins change the ion transport of vCLCs, we chose ClC-5 which yields the largest plasma membrane (PM) currents. ClC-5 currents were abolished by co-expressing either T9A or T9B in Xenopus oocytes (Fig.\u00a03a) or HeLa cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). This is in line with the recent observation that T9B inhibits ClC-3 and ClC-4 PM currents by unknown mechanisms. T9 proteins may have decreased ClC-5 surface expression and/or inhibited its ion transport. Surface expression of a ClC-5 mutant carrying extracellular HA epitopes was strongly reduced by T9A or T9B (Fig.\u00a03b). This does not exclude an additional inhibitory effect on ClC-5 transport activity.\nIntracellular retention of ClC-5 might result from an interaction of T9 C-termini with the cytoplasmic sorting machinery. While a large truncation of the T9B C-terminus (\u0394Clarge, Fig.\u00a03c) no longer suppressed currents and allowed surface expression of co-expressed HA-ClC-5, a smaller deletion (\u0394Csmall, Fig.\u00a03c) suppressed both HA-ClC-5 PM expression and currents (Fig.\u00a03d,e). Further mutants revealed that the stretch deleted in \u0394Cint_prox is responsible for reducing surface expression. Of note, although T9B\u0394Cint_prox co-expression allowed ClC-5 surface expression, it still suppressed ClC-5 currents.\nAlthough \u0394Cint_prox had similar effects with T9A and T9B, the deleted sequences lack significant homology (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a). However, they contain conspicuous clusters of negative charges. In their vicinity, we found serines and threonines reported to be phosphorylated (www.phosphosite.org) (T9A: 137Thr; T9B: 138Ser, 143Ser). Proteomic analysis of mouse brain additionally revealed phosphorylation of 122Tyr and 123Thr that precede the acidic cluster of T9A (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). This suggested the presence of phosphorylated Acidic Clusters (pACs) that are implicated in endocytic trafficking and Golgi targeting of membrane proteins. Similar Ser-, Thr- or Tyr-containing acidic clusters are found in T9 proteins from distant phyla (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b). Replacing three negatively charged residues by alanine in T9A\u0394pAC and T9B\u0394pAC (Fig.\u00a03c) indeed increased PM expression of co-expressed HA-ClC-5 (Fig.\u00a03f,g) without, however, enabling chloride currents (Fig.\u00a03i). T9A\u0394pAC also augmented PM expression of ClC-3 in HeLa cells (Fig.\u00a03j). Eliminating potentially phosphorylated residues in these clusters moderately increased ClC-5 surface expression with T9AY122A and T9AT123A (Fig.\u00a03f). With T9B, S138A, but not S143A, enhanced HA-ClC-5 PM expression (Fig.\u00a03g). If ClC-5 and T9 traffic as stable complexes, T9 mutations should similarly affect the PM residence of both proteins. Indeed, epitope-tagged HA-T9B showed increased surface expression with deletions eliminating pAC (Fig.\u00a03e).\nT9 C-terminal inhibitory domains (CID) inhibit vCLC ion flux\nDeleting T9 C-termini almost entirely (\u0394Clarge mutants) allowed surface expression and currents of co-expressed ClC-5, whereas with T9\u0394Cint_prox or T9\u0394pAC, ClC-5 resided at the PM without yielding currents. This suggested that T9 C-termini inhibit ClC-5 ion transport. Interestingly, currents were observed when ClC-5 was co-expressed with T9\u0394pAC mutants with C-terminally added HA-epitopes (Fig.\u00a03h). We hypothesized that the tags might interfere with the recognition of a C-terminal inhibitory domain (\u2018CID\u2019).\nThe ~20 most distal residues of T9 proteins are highly conserved between T9A and T9B (Fig.\u00a03c) and between distant animal phyla (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a,b). Compatible with a regulatory role, C-terminal T9B residue 190Ser can be phosphorylated (www.phosphosite.org). Centered on this residue we replaced five amino-acids by alanines in mutants T9A\u0394CID and T9B\u0394CID (Fig.\u00a03c). When combined with mutations allowing PM expression in T9A\u0394pAC,\u0394CID and T9B\u0394pAC,\u0394CID, the inhibitory effect on ClC-5 currents was relieved (Fig.\u00a03i). This was also observed with alanine substitutions on both sides of this short stretch (Fig.\u00a03c,i), suggesting that inhibition of ion transport requires a rather long carboxy-terminal domain. T9\u0394pAC,\u0394CID did not change ClC-5 current properties (Fig.\u00a03a,i). Importantly, neither the C-terminal addition of an HA-epitope, nor the \u0394CID mutation changed the effect of T9A on surface expression of co-expressed ClC-5 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07). This suggests that pAC and CID domains specifically affect surface expression and ion transport capacity, respectively, of ClC-5 and other vCLCs.\nThe majority of ClC-3, -4 and -5 localizes to, and functions in, endosomes. To test for CLC ion transport activity in their native environment, we examined the generation of large vesicles by ClC-3 overexpression, an effect which is not observed with ClC-4 or ClC-5 (Fig.\u00a04a). Mutations uncoupling Cl\u2212 from H+ transport had previously revealed that vacuolization depends on Cl\u2212/H+ exchange. This dependence was also found with vacuoles induced by pathogenic variants of ClC-6 or ClC-7. We re-examined the effect of E282A uncoupling unc mutation, which converts ClC-3 into a pure Cl\u2212 conductor, on vacuolization (Fig.\u00a04b). This mutation suppressed, and the transport-deficient td mutation E339A, which almost eliminates both Cl\u2212- and H+ transport, prevented vacuolization (Fig.\u00a04b). Hence, vesicle enlargement can be used to assay ion transport by vCLCs.\nVacuoles generated by ClC-3 overexpression were acidified (Fig.\u00a04b). Although Lysosensor\u00ae staining was variable, overall Lysosensor\u00ae fluorescence could be used as semi-quantitative readout for large vesicles in flow cytometry (FC) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08a). Transfection of Venus-ClC-3 into HeLa cells led to a population of cells displaying increased Lysosensor\u00ae fluorescence which, confirming the imaging data, was strongly reduced when ClC-3 carried unc or td mutations (Fig.\u00a04c).\nT9A or T9B co-transfection suppressed ClC-3-induced vacuolization (Fig.\u00a04d). This suppression depended on direct protein interactions because it was not observed with Ostm1/T9 chimeras that cannot bind vCLCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08b). Suppression of vacuolization depended on T9 C-termini. Co-expressing ClC-3 with T9A\u0394CID or T9B\u0394CID gave large vesicles (Fig.\u00a04e), as did co-expression with T9B\u0394CID_prox, T9B\u0394CID_dist and T9B\u0394CID_xdist mutants (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08c), confirming the extension of CID as determined by electrophysiology (Fig.\u00a03i). T9\u0394CID mutants co-localized with ClC-3 on giant vacuoles (Fig.\u00a04e), indicating that the lack of inhibition is not due to a dissociation of T9\u0394CID proteins from ClC-3.\nRole of T9 CID\u2014vCLC interactions in regulation and disease\nThe inhibition of CLC ion transport by T9 proteins may involve direct CID-CLC interactions. This notion was supported by activity-dependent antibody accessibility of carboxy-terminal T9 epitopes. In cells co-transfected with Venus-ClC-3 and T9A, ClC-3 was found on vesicular, endosome-like structures. Surprisingly, these structures almost lacked labeling with antibodies against T9 C-termini (Figs.\u00a03j,\u00a04f). T9A was rather found in ER-like structures. However, T9AC2 and T9BC2 antibodies detected T9A and T9B, respectively, on large vacuoles generated by GFP-ClC-3/T9\u0394CID (Fig.\u00a04e). Hence, apparent co-localization of both proteins correlated with ClC-3 disinhibition. We speculated that the epitopes recognized by T9AC2 and T9BC2 antibodies (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a), although not directly located in CID, might be shielded by CID binding to ClC-3. Indeed, co-transfected N-terminally HA-tagged T9A was detected on small ClC-3-positive puncta by anti-HA (Fig. 4fC), but not by T9AC2 antibodies (Fig. 4fB). Both antibodies detected T9A on the large vacuoles generated by ClC-3/T9A\u0394CID (Fig. 4gB,C). We conclude that CID inhibits ion transport by binding to ClC-3 and that relief from inhibition involves CID/CLC dissociation. Epitope-shielding likely contributes to the difficulties in localizing T9 proteins to defined subcellular structures of native cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a,b).\nTo find CID binding sites on ClC-3, we were guided by the previous identification of the linker connecting helices J and K as \u2018receptor\u2019 for an inhibitory N-terminal domain of ClC-2. Replacing part of the JK linker of ClC-3 by that of ClC-2 in ClC-3JK_C2 indeed made the T9 epitope accessible for the T9AC2 antibody (Fig.\u00a04h) and relieved the inhibitory effect of T9A (Fig.\u00a05a,b). Three disease-causing CLCN4 mutations, R360S, R364G and P369L, change JK linker residues. Vacuole generation by ClC-3R418S, the equivalent to ClC-4R360S, was resistant to T9A inhibition, as was vacuolization by ClC-3K422G (\u2009\u2248\u2009ClC-4R364G) (Fig.\u00a05c). No effect on T9A inhibition was found with ClC-3P427L (\u2009\u2248\u2009ClC-4P369L). T9B had similar effects as T9A (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09a). This suggested that ClC-4R360S and ClC-4R364G cause disease by a detrimental gain of function.\nTo search for additional mutants able to relieve T9-mediated inhibition, we analyzed pathogenic CLCN4 mutations affecting cytoplasmic residues without changing currents. Seven disease-associated mutations in the first CBS domain of ClC-4 mostly give WT currents. When equivalent mutations where inserted into ClC-3, only ClC-3R710T (\u2009\u2248\u2009ClC-4R652T) and ClC-3T713V (\u2009\u2248\u2009ClC-4I655V) generated giant vesicles in the presence of T9A or T9B (Fig.\u00a05d, Supplementary Fig.\u00a09b). However, none of equivalent ClC-5 mutants yielded detectable currents together with T9A\u0394pAC (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010c). Hence the degree of disinhibition of ion transport by pathogenic CLCN4 R652T and I655V mutants and their ClC-3 and ClC-5 equivalents is incomplete. However, this partial activation of CLC/T9 ion transport suffices to enlarge vesicles and to cause disease.\nMapping the seven ClC-4 CBS1 mutants to the structure of ClC-3 revealed that 710Arg (652Arg in ClC-4) and 713Thr (655Ile in ClC-4) are located on the same side of the second \u03b1-helix of CBS1 and face the cytosol where they might interact with CID (Fig.\u00a05e). Residues lacking an effect on CID-mediated inhibition are rather buried in the protein (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010a). Roughly between 710Arg and the JK linker we find three more residues implicated in disease, amino-terminal 85Tyr and 87Asp and the DE-linker residue 252Ile (Fig.\u00a05e). ClC-3Y85C and ClC-3I252T are associated with CLCN3 neuropathy, and ClC-4D29E (\u2009\u2248\u2009ClC-3D87E) with CLCN4 disease. Transfection of either ClC-3Y85C, ClC-3D87E, or ClC-3I252T elicited T9A- and T9B-resistant vacuolization (Fig.\u00a05f,g, Supplementary Fig.\u00a09c-d), again suggesting that these human mutations cause disease by increasing endolysosomal 2Cl\u2212/H+ exchange.\nDatabases (www.phosphosite.org) report phosphorylation of ClC-3 718Ser and 713Thr, the equivalent to ClC-4 665Ile which is mutated in disease and that was studied above. Both residues are located on the same face of the CBS1 helix (Fig.\u00a05e). Replacing both residues by phosphorylation-mimicking Glu led to T9-resistant vacuolization (Fig.\u00a06a). The database also reports phosphorylation of 190Ser in the CID of T9B. Mutating this residue to Glu or Asp led to moderately enlarged vesicles in cells co-transfected with ClC-3 (Fig.\u00a06b). Hence, phosphorylation of either ClC-3 or T9 residues may activate ion transport by weakening CLC/T9 interactions.\nCollectively, these results suggest that CIDs of T9 \u03b2-subunits inhibit CLC ion transport by interacting with an extended region formed by the second \u03b1-helix of CBS1, residues of the amino-terminus, and the DE and JK linkers. Several pathogenic mutants of ClC-3 or ClC-4 cause a toxic gain of function because they are partially resistant to inhibition by T9 \u03b2-subunits. Phosphorylation of interacting residues may physiologically regulate vCLC activity.\nCorrectly targeted ClC-4 and ClC-5 can cause vacuolization\nThe fact that overexpression of ClC-3, but not of ClC-4 and -5, caused vacuolization (Fig.\u00a04a) might result from different subcellular localization. As ClC-5 apparently enabled the transport of T9B to endosomes in kidney (Fig.\u00a02g), we asked whether, conversely, T9B carried ClC-5 to endosomes. T9B co-transfection indeed changed the mainly ER-like staining pattern of ClC-5 to punctate, endosome-like labeling (Fig.\u00a06c). Co-expressing ClC-5 with T9B\u0394CID or T9A\u0394CID led to massive vacuolization (Fig.\u00a06d), suggesting that vacuole formation by ClC-5 requires its localization to endosomes. By contrast, no vacuolization was observed with ClC-4/T9A\u0394CID (Fig.\u00a06e). ClC-4 needs ClC-3 rather than T9 to traffic to endosomes as heterodimer. Co-expressing transport-deficient ClC-3td with ClC-4 generated giant vesicles which were inhibited by T9A (Fig.\u00a06f). These vacuoles were generated by ion transport through ClC-4 as these are the only transport-competent subunits in ClC-3td/ClC-4 dimers. Hence not only overactivity of ClC-3, but also of ClC-4 and ClC-5 causes vacuolization when these proteins are directed to endosomal compartments.\nThese results allowed us to re-examine pathogenic ClC-4 mutants in their native sequence context. We chose ClC-4R360S (ref. ) which we had tested with the equivalent ClC-3R418S mutant (Fig.\u00a05c). T9 co-expression suppressed vacuolization elicited by ClC-3/ClC-4 (Fig.\u00a06g), but not by ClC-3/ ClC-4R360S (Fig.\u00a06h), validating our ClC-3 based test of human mutants.",
        "DISCUSS": "Discussion\nWe have identified T9A (TMEM9) and T9B (TMEM9B) as obligatory \u03b2-subunits for ClC-3 to ClC-5 2Cl\u2212/H+-exchangers. They are required for CLC protein stability and regulate diverse trafficking steps and ion transport activity (Fig.\u00a07). Their physiological importance is evident from the lethality of T9a\u2212/\u2212/T9b\u2212/\u2212 mice and from disease-associated CLCN3 and CLCN4 mutations that weaken inhibition by T9. Our work uncovered relief from tonic, \u03b2-subunit mediated inhibition as an efficient mechanism for regulating endosomal ion transport.\nT9 proteins are crucial for endosomal targeting of ClC-3 to ClC-5. We discovered that T9 proteins foster the transport of ClC-5 from the ER to endosomes (Fig.\u00a06c,d). They also prevented vCLC accumulation at the plasma membrane (Figs.\u00a03b,\u00a07), which they reach in a recycling process. The decrease in surface expression depended on a phosphorylated acidic cluster (pAC) motif. This matches pAC\u2019s role in endocytosis. Since pACs regulate diverse trafficking steps, we cannot exclude that other trafficking steps of CLC/T9 complexes, including the ER to endosome transport of ClC-5 (Fig.\u00a06c,d), are influenced by pAC. Of note, the function of pAC motifs depends on phosphorylation of nearby Ser or Thr residues. Our work suggests that Tyr phosphorylation may also modulate the function of pACs (Fig.\u00a03f).\nThe surprising strong inhibition of vCLC ion transport by T9 proteins provides previously unknown possibilities for regulating Cl\u2212/H+ exchange. The length of the CLC/T9 interface, as deduced here from functional studies and later confirmed by cryo-EM structures, suggests that posttranslational modifications may synergistically activate vCLCs. Phosphorylation-mimicking mutations (Fig.\u00a06a,b) indicated that phosphorylation of both vCLC and T9 proteins may activate Cl\u2212/H+ exchange. The identification of relevant kinases and phosphatases is are important goal for future research.\nThe strong inhibition of ion transport by T9 proteins is unusual for \u03b2-subunits, but makes biological sense. First, it prevents deleterious effects of unchecked endolysosomal 2Cl\u2212/H+-exchange. Second, it allows large increases in transport rates when strong inhibition is relieved by regulatory mechanisms.\nOverexpression of ClC-3 or of disease-associated activating mutants of ClC-6 and ClC-7 generates large lamp1-positive vesicles. Our work extends this observation to ClC-4 and ClC-5, provided they are targeted to endosomes (Fig.\u00a06d, f). Vacuole formation probably involves osmotic swelling by pH- and voltage-driven luminal Cl\u2212 accumulation through electrogenic 2Cl\u2212/H+-exchange. Mechanical stretching of their membrane impairs binding of curvature-recognizing proteins, thereby inhibiting vesicle budding, but not vesicle fusion. Like described for ClC-6 and ClC-7, many giant vesicles were poorly acidified. We propose that they have reached a quiescent state in which a positive luminal potential largely shuts down endolysosomal ion transporters (Supplementary Note).\nGiven the harmful effects of excessive Cl\u2212/H+-exchange, it must be strictly controlled. Lysosomal ClC-7 is inhibited by PI(3,5)P2. Disrupting this inhibition entails severe pathology. With ClC-6, its extreme voltage-dependence may prevent toxic Cl\u2212/H+-exchange. We now found that ClC-3 to ClC-5 use regulated inhibition by associated \u03b2-subunits. Although Cl\u2212/H+ exchange of individual vCLCs is grossly stimulated by the absence of T9, no vacuoles were observed in T9A/B double-KO cells. This may be explained by the concomitant decrease of vCLC protein levels (Fig.\u00a02c). Likewise, it is unclear whether the lethality of T9a\u2212/\u2212/T9b\u2212/\u2212 mice is owed to the loss of vCLCs, as suggested by the lethality of vCLC double KO mice. The decrease in vCLC expression might be offset, or even overcompensated, by the loss of T9-mediated ion transport inhibition.\nThe inhibitory effect of the C-terminus involved residues distributed over a stretch of about 20 amino-acids which we named C-terminal Inhibitory Domain (CID). The length of this domain allows, in principle, synergistic effects of posttranslational modifications of several residues. Such modifications probably require low affinity of CLC/CID binding in order for kinases to gain intermittent access. The length of CID agrees well with the positions of human mutants that interfere with inhibition. Single point mutations in either CID or interacting CLC regions only partially destabilized the interaction as revealed by mild functional effects. Effects of point mutations were only detected with the vesicle assay but not with PM currents. This comes down to the sensitivity of these assays. Currents must exceed >10% of maximal ClC-5 currents to be distinguishable from background. By contrast, starting from possibly near-total inhibition of endosomal CLCs, relative increases of ion exchange rates might even span orders of magnitude while lacking detectable effects on PM currents. Although disinhibition of Cl\u2212/H+ exchange by human mutations may be small, it suffices to cause severe disease.\nIt is enthralling to compare CID-mediated regulation of vCLCs to the gating of the ClC-2. The slow hyperpolarization- and swelling-induced opening of this plasma membrane Cl\u2212 channel involves a \u201cball and chain\u201c mechanism. An inhibitory stretch of its cytoplasmic amino-terminus (the \u2018ball\u2019) interacts with a \u201creceptor\u201d on the cytoplasmic surface of the channel which includes, just like observed here for CID, a portion of the J-K linker. A recent cryo-EM study confirmed these results and revealed that part of the ClC-2 N-terminus blocks the cytosolic opening of the channel\u2019s pore. Likewise, our companion cryo-EM study shows that T9A\u2019s CID blocks the cytoplasmic mouth of the Cl\u2212 permeation pathway through ClC-3. The blockade of ClC-2 by its N-terminus is clearly reversible because it can be relieved by hyperpolarization and other factors. Our data suggest that likewise CID-mediated inhibition of vCLCs is reversible and might be modulated by phosphorylation. The regulation of ion transport of the ClC-2 Cl\u2212 channel and of vCLC Cl\u2212/H+-exchangers by the N-terminus of the same protein, and C-terminus of associated \u03b2-subunits, respectively, constitute an intriguing example of convergent evolution.\nCurrents reported for ClC-3 to ClC-5 always involved CLC overexpression and thus missed effects of their \u03b2-subunits. Our study leads to the reclassification of several disease-associated CLCN3 and CLCN4 variants as gain-of-function mutants. These variants caused vacuolization upon overexpression. Activating CLCN7 mutations can cause vacuolization in patients\u2019 tissues, but it is unclear whether this occurs in CLCN3 or CLCN4 neuropathy patients whose mutations we have analyzed here. Excessive endosomal Cl\u2212/H+-exchange may be pathogenic well below the threshold for giant vacuole formation.\nNot only CLCN3 and CLCN4 mutations might cause disease by weakening CID-mediated inhibition, but also mutations in T9 genes. A loss of either T9A or T9B might produce only mild symptoms because both subunits partially substitute for each other. Point mutations affecting CID may cause more harm than a complete loss of one T9 isoform. This is because CLC/T9 association does not require T9 C-termini and bound mutants cannot be replaced by WT counterparts. Since activating mutations in CLCN3 and CLCN4 are associated with neurological disease, we expect to find T9 CID mutations in nervous system disorders.\nBy identifying and characterizing TMEM9 and TMEM9B as \u03b2-subunits of ClC-3 to ClC-5, we have uncovered previously unknown mechanisms to regulate trafficking and ion transport of endosomal CLCs (Fig.\u00a07). Crucially, our work has revealed the necessity to tonically suppress endolysosomal Cl\u2212/H+ exchange activity. Weakening this inhibition can lead to severe cellular and organismal pathology. Several human ClC-3 and ClC-4 mutants underlying neurological disease display reduced sensitivity to T9-mediated inhibition. Our conclusion that the inhibitory C-terminus interacts with various cytoplasmic parts, including residues in CBS domains, the N-terminus, and two intracellular loops of CLCs, is confirmed by cryo-EM structures we have recently obtained. This study also finds that CID-CLC interactions are partially mediated by interposed PI(3,5)P2 molecules. Several aspects of endosomal CLCs must be revisited. Our work creates the basis for understanding the regulation of endosomal Cl\u2212 and H+ transport and its impact on physiology and disease.",

They normally largely inhibit CLC ion transport by blocking the cytoplasmic opening of the Cl- permeation pathway with part of their Cytoplasmic Inhibitory Domain (CID) located at the extreme C-terminus. In CLC exchangers, separate pathways for Cl- and H+ connect the cytoplasm to the Cl\u2212/H+ exchange site in the center of the protein. Cytoplasmic phosphorylated Acidic Clusters (pAC) of T9 proteins stimulate the removal of vCLC/T9 complexes from the plasma membrane, leading to a predominant endosomal localization. pAC mutations shift the equilibrium to the PM. b Disturbing the binding of CID to cytoplasmic parts of vCLCs by either mutating CID or interacting vCLC residues (as with several disease-causing CLCN mutations, yellow asterisk) disinhibits (activates) vCLCs. An inside-out proton gradient, generated by the vesicular H+-ATPase, causes excessive luminal Cl\u2212 accumulation through 2Cl\u2212/H+-exchange. The resulting osmotic gradient, which inhibits vesicle budding, entails apparent swelling of endolysosomal compartments.",
        "METHODS": "Methods\nHigh-resolution complexome profiling (csBN-MS)\nPlasma membrane-enriched fractions were prepared from two freshly isolated mouse brains, solubilized and processed following the complexome-profiling procedure. Protein complexes (solubilized in ComplexioLyte 47a (Logopharm) with salt replaced by 750\u2009mM aminocapronic acid) were enriched by ultracentrifugation into a sucrose cushion (20%/50% sucrose), supplemented with 0.125% Coomassie G250 and resolved on a hyperbolic 1-18% preparative native gel (BN-PAGE). The gel lane section of interest was embedded and sliced into 0.3\u2009mm sections using a cryo-microtome (Leica) as detailed in ref. . After in-gel tryptic digestion, samples were analyzed on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer coupled to an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano HPLC system (Thermo Scientific, Germany). Mass spectrometric raw data were processed as in ref.  with the following modifications: after off-line correction of precursor mass offsets, MS data was searched with PEAKS 11 (Bioinformatics Solutions, Inc.) against the UniProt mouse reference database (UP000000589). Identification threshold for protein groups was set to 1%, proteins either representing exogenous contaminations (e.g., keratins, trypsin, IgG chains) or identified by less than 5 specific peptides were not further considered. For quantitative evaluation, ion intensities (integrated peak volumes, PVs) were extracted and mass calibrated by MaxQuant v1.6.3 (http://www.maxquant.org) and assigned to peptides after retention time-alignment of runs, consistency-filtered using the Expector procedure and protein abundance profiles determined. Slice numbers were converted to apparent complex molecular weights by fitting of log(MW) of marker complexes versus their observed profile peak maxima slice index using a sigmoidal function. Protein abundance profiles were finally smoothed using a Gaussian filter (width set to 1.4).\nMolecular biology\nTmem9 and Tmem9b cDNAs were cloned by RT-PCR from total RNA isolated from C57BL/6\u2009N mouse kidney using TRIZOL (Invitrogen) and RNeasy columns (Qiagen). RT-PCR used SuperScript\u2122 II reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT)15 primers for cDNA synthesis. PCR products were cloned into pCDNA3.1 (Thermo Fisher). Epitope tag insertions, chimaeras, deletions, and mutations were generated by recombinant PCR or by using the QuikChange kit (Agilent). For site-directed mutagenesis, oligonucleotides were designed using the \u2018QuickChange Primer Design\u2019 tool (https://www.agilent.com/store/primerDesignProgram.jsp) from Agilent. Human ClC-5 cDNA was subcloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), mouse ClC-3c, human ClC-3a, -4, -5, and -7 cDNAs into a modified pEGFP-C1 vector where EGFP was replaced by mVenus. All clones were verified by sequencing the entire ORF.\nThree HA-epitopes were fused either to the C-termini of T9A and T9B, or inserted shortly after the predicted cleavable signal peptide (Supplementary Table\u00a01). To detect surface expression of ClC-5, we had previously inserted HA-epitopes into the first extracellular loop of ClC-5. For the present study, this construct is useless because this loop binds the extracellular domain of T9 proteins. We therefore inserted a large flexible 163 residue-long unstructured polypeptide with three HA-epitopes into the extracellular/luminal loop, encoded by sequence generated by DNA synthesis, between helices L and M of ClC-5 (Supplementary Table\u00a01). The mutant was functional, but gave less current than WT ClC-5 and appeared less sensitive to T9 inhibition. The respective constructs were inserted into pTLN and pCDNA for oocyte and HeLa or HEK 293 expression, respectively.\nTo study which domains of T9A associate to GFP-ClC-5, several chimeras were generated that exchanged different domains (N-, C-, and transmembrane TMD) of T9A with the corresponding domains of mouse Ostm1. Specifically, the T9A N-term encompassed 1M-89K, the C-term 111L-183S, and the TM from 90V-110M. For Ostm1, N-term (1M-288S), C-term (310H-338T), and TMD (289V-309L).\nCell culture and transfection\nHEK 293 and HeLa cells were obtained from the Leibniz-Institut DSMZ- Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Germany. Both cell lines were maintained in complete medium (DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) at 37\u2009\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected using either JetPrime (Polyplus), PEI (polyethylenimine), or Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher).\nGeneration of monoclonal knockout cell lines\nHeLa cell lines with disruptions in Tmem9 or Tmem9b genes were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 using the px330 system and the following guides: 5\u2019 GCTGTGCGAGTGCAGGTACG 3\u2019 for T9A\u2212/\u2212 and 5\u2019 ATCAGGCCCCCGCACAGGCA 3\u2019 for T9B\u2212/\u2212. Selected clones were analyzed by target site-specific PCR on genomic DNA followed by Sanger-sequencing, revealing frame shifts and early translation terminations. Clones were further confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence with custom made antibodies.\nGeneration of Tmem9 and Tmem9b knock-out mice\nKnock-out Tmem9 and Tmem9b mice were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing by the MDC Transgenic Core Facility (Berlin). Briefly, one guide sgRNA 5\u2019 GCGGACAGATGCATTTGCAC 3\u2019 targeting exon 3 of Tmem9 and a second guide sgRNA 5\u2019 TATGGTGCGGAAACCTGCTG 3\u2019 targeting exon 1 of Tmem9b were co-injected by pronuclear microinjection in fertilized C57BL/6\u2009N mouse oocytes that were implanted into foster mothers. One founder carrying a 37\u2009bp deletion in Tmem9 and one founder with 32\u2009bp deletion in Tmem9b, leading to frameshift and early protein translation terminations, were selected. Nucleotide deletions were confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequence analyses. Founders were backcrossed a minimum of three times with C57BL/6\u2009N mice to generate Tmem9+/\u2212 or Tmem9b+/\u2212 animals, verified by PCR genotyping and genome sequencing. For PCR genotyping, genomic DNA was amplified in 30 cycles (30\u2009s, 94\u2009\u00b0C; 45\u2009s, 60\u2009\u00b0C; and 30\u2009s, 72\u2009\u00b0C) on a thermal cycler. For Tmem9a, primers 5\u2032 GCACGTCACTTCATGGATG 3\u2032 and 5\u2019 CAGCCATTAGCAGTGTCTTAC 3\u2019 amplified a 370\u2009bp or 333\u2009bp band for the WT or KO allele, respectively. For Tmem9b, primers 5\u2032 TAAGGCTTAGGATGCTCTAGAG 3\u2032 and 5\u2019 AGCCTATGGTGCGGAAACC 3\u2019 amplified a 275\u2009bp or 243\u2009bp band for the WT or KO allele, respectively. These were used for the establishment of the single and double KO mouse lines. Tmem9\u2212/\u2212 and Tmem9b\u2212/\u2212 mice were viable and fertile. Double KO animals were never found in more than 30 litters, as further confirmed in breeding pairs using homozygous KO mice for one T9 gene and heterozygous for the other.\nFrom double heterozygous (Tmem9+/\u2212, Tmem9b+/\u2212) breedings, we obtained a total of 98 embryos at age E12.5 of which 6 were double KO, 6 WT, 4 T9A-KO, and 7 B-KO, in good agreement with the expected ratio (6.25%). The gross morphology of double KO E12.5 embryos was normal. E12.5 embryos were used to generate independent mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that gave similar results in our assays.\nAbsence of protein expression in KO mice was validated by Western blot using custom-made antibodies.\nClcn mouse models\nThe Clcn mouse models used in this study had been generated in the Jentsch lab and were first described in the following publications: Clcn3\u2212/\u2212 mice, ref. ; Venus-ClC-3 mice, ref. ; Clcn4\u2212/\u2212mice, ref. ; and Clcn5\u2212/\u2212mice, ref. . These mice were maintained in B6/SVJ mixed background.\nAnimal experiments\nAll experiments with mice, including the generation of new mouse lines, breeding, organ collection or perfusion were approved by Berlin authorities (LAGeSo) under licenses G 0111/17-21012, G 0051/22, X 9011/22, T-02-2024, G 0005/19, G 0045/24, O 0380/17 and G 0041/23. Surgery and maintenance of Xenopus laevis frogs were approved by LAGeSo under license E 0103/23. Animals were housed in the MDC and FMP animal facilities according to institutional guidelines and under supervision by the authorities.\nPrimary culture of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)\nMurine BMDMs were isolated from 6 to 8 weeks C57Bl/6\u2009N adult tibiae and femora from both sexes. Cells were flushed from bone, and erythrocytes lysed in red blood cell lysis buffer (Abcam, ab204733). Remaining cells were resuspended in complete DMEM medium. Four hours after seeding, non-attached cells were cultured in complete DMEM containing 20\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121 recombinant murine M-CSF (Pepro Tech, 315-02). Cells were used 6-14 days later. M-CSF concentration was increased to 100\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121 to induce micropinocytosis and then fixed after incubation for 5-10\u2009min. To obtain embryonic fibroblasts, eviscerated trunks from E11.5-12.5 embryos were minced and incubated in 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (GIBCO) for 30\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C and later mechanically homogenized. After trypsin inactivation in complete medium (DMEM plus 10% FBS), cells were cultured up to six passages.\nEvaluation of differentially expressed genes by qRT-PCR\nThree 8-10 weeks-old C57Bl/6\u2009N WT and T9A- and T9B-KO littermates from either sex were used per organ. RNA was isolated from tissues, and cDNA synthesized using used SuperScript\u2122 II reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and oligo(dT)15 primers. qRT-PCR was run in a StepOne Plus (Applied System Biosystems) (StepOne software v2.3) using the SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The following pairs of primers were used for qRT-PCR: for ClCN3 5\u2019 tgtaactcacaacggacgcctc 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 tattgaagcggggtcttggttt 3\u2019 (ref. ), for ClCN4 5\u2019 gcgtctcatcgggtttgc 3\u2019and 5\u2019 ttgccacaatgccctcttg 3\u2019 (ref. ), for ClCN5 5\u2019 aatcatcaccaaaaaggatgtgttaa 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 ccatggtccgcaatgtcc 3\u2018 (ref. ), for GAPDH 5\u2019 agcctcgtcccgtagacaaaa 3\u2019 and 5\u2018 tggcaacaatctccactttgc 3\u2018 (ref. ), for Tmem9 5\u2018 gtccgccttacagaaacatca 3\u2019 and 5\u2019ctcgtacctacactcgcagag 3\u2019, PrimerBank-MGH-PGA Harvard U., and for Tmem9b 5\u2019 ctatggtgcggaaacctgct 3\u2019 and 5\u2018 gcccaggattctctttataggga 3\u2019, PrimerBank-MGH-PGA, Harvard. Reactions were performed in triplicate with cDNAs from at least three different animal pairs. Fold changes were calculated and geometrically averaged.\nGeneration and characterization of Tmem9/9B antibodies\nPolyclonal antibodies against different peptides in the C-terminal intracellular domain of mouse TMEM9 (T9A) and TMEM9B (T9B) were generated, both in rabbits and guinea pigs, by Pineda Antibody Service (Berlin) and Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). Antigen sequences are depicted in Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a. Peptides were coupled to KLH via N-terminally added cysteines. Sera were affinity-purified against the respective peptides, and their specificity was ascertained by Western blot and immunofluorescence in both WT/KO Hela cells and WT/KO mice.\nWestern blot analysis of tissue extracts\nOrgans were harvested from adult mice of different genotypes and sexes, which were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and membrane fractions prepared. Briefly, tissues were homogenized in HBS Buffer containing (in mM): 20 Hepes pH 7.4, 150 NaCl, 5 EDTA, 4 Pefabloc (Roth), and Complete\u00ae (Roche) protease-inhibitors. After being cleared twice by centrifugation at 900\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C, membranes were pelleted at 100,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Pellets were resuspended by sonication in HBS containing 1% Tx-100, incubated 30\u2009min on ice, and then centrifuged for 10\u2009min at 20,800\u2009\u00d7\u2009g at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Protein concentration of the supernatants was determined by BCA, and equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE. Equal loading was ascertained by staining for actin or GAPDH.\nCo-immunoprecipitation\nHeLa cells transfected with C-terminally HA-tagged T9A and N-terminally tagged Venus-ClC-3a, -3c, --4, -5 or -7 were collected and lysed in HBS buffer containing 1% n-dodecyl-\u03b2-maltoside (DDM, Glycon), plus Pefabloc (Roth) and Complete\u00ae protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at \u223c72,000\u2009g for 30\u2009min and incubated overnight with Pierce\u00ae anti-HA magnetic beads (Thermo Fisher). To study T9A domains able to associate to GFP-ClC-5, HEK 293 cells expressing different HA-tagged chimeras of T9A were processed as above, but lysates were incubated for 2\u2009h with GFP-Trap\u00ae Magnetic Agarose beads (ProteinTech). After extensive washing, proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer and denatured. Lysate equivalent to 10% of input and eluates were loaded and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against GFP and HA.\nMulti-epitope affinity purification mass spectrometry (meAP-MS)\nMouse brains from different genotypes (WT, transgenic Venus-ClC-3, T9A\u2212/\u2212, and T9B\u2212/\u2212) were collected and snap-frozen. Brain tissues were then homogenized at 10\u2009ml/g tissue in buffer containing (in mM): 320 sucrose, 10 Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1.5 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, and protease inhibitors, with a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged for 5\u2009min at 1080\u2009x\u2009g. Pellets were re-homogenized in 8\u2009ml buffer and centrifuged as before. Combined supernatants were ultracentrifuged (12\u2009min at 150,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g (for r(avg), Sorvall S80 AT3). Obtained pellets were hypotonically lysed by resuspension (at 10\u2009ml/g tissue) in buffer containing (in mM): 5 Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 EDTA, and protease inhibitors using a syringe with narrow cannula. After incubation for 45\u2009min on ice, lysates were transferred to ultracentrifugation soft tubes, underlayered with 15\u2009ml 0.5\u2009M sucrose and 15\u2009ml 1.3\u2009M sucrose and ultracentrifuged for 45\u2009min at 111,000\u2009g (for r(avg), Beckmann SW32 Ti). Membrane vesicle bands at the sucrose interfaces were collected, diluted 2.5x with 20\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, and pelleted by ultracentrifugation (25\u2009min at 150,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g (for r(avg), Sorvall Ti 865). Membrane pellets were resuspended in dilution buffer, volume adjusted to 10\u2009mg/ml (Bradford assay, Bio-Rad), and snap-frozen in liquid N2.\nFor affinity purification, aliquots of 1-2\u2009mg membrane were solubilized (at 0.9\u2009ml/mg protein) in ComplexioLyte 47 (Logopharm) with protease inhibitors (incubation for 20\u2009min on ice, ultracentrifugation for 12\u2009min at 150,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g (for r(avg), Sorvall S80 AT3) and incubated with 10-20\u2009\u00b5g of the following antibodies (immobilized on Protein A / Protein G magnetic beads (according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions; Invitrogen): anti-GFP (Roche #11814460001, R&D Systems #AF4240), anti-TMEM9 \u201cT9AC2\u201d rb 1, anti-TMEM9 \u201cT9AC2\u201d rb 2, anti-TMEM9 \u201cT9AC2\u201d gp 1, anti-TMEM9 \u201cT9Act\u201d-rb 2, anti-TMEM9B (Proteintech #24331-1-AP), anti-TMEM9B \u201cT9BC2\u201d, anti-TMEM9B \u201cT9BC1\u201d, anti-TMEM9B \u201cT9BCt\u201d-gp2 and different mixtures from normal rabbit / mouse / goat IgG (Upstate and Santa Cruz) as negative controls. After incubation for 3\u2009h on a rotating wheel, beads were transferred to new reaction tubes, washed twice 10\u2009min with 1\u2009ml ComplexioLyte 47 dilution buffer (Logopharm), and eluted twice with non-reducing Laemmli buffer (100\u2009mM DTT added after elution). Samples were shortly run on SDS-PAGE gels, silver-stained, and higher- (\u2009>\u200950\u2009kDa) and lower molecular weight (\u2009<\u200950\u2009kDa) sections were excised for in-gel tryptic digestion (sequencing grade trypsin, Promega).\nPeptide samples were dissolved in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed with an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer equipped with an autosampler Ultimate 3000 nano-HPLC (all Thermo Fisher Scientific; C18 pre-column (PepMap100, 5\u2009mm particles), SilicaTip emitter (75\u2009mm i.d., 8\u2009mm tip, New Objective Inc) manually packed with ReproSil-Pur 120 ODS-3 (C18; particle size 3\u2009\u00b5m; Dr. Maisch HPLC, Germany). Bound peptides were eluted with an aqueous-organic gradient (from 0.5% acetic acid to 80% acetonitrile / 0.5% acetic acid) and directly electrosprayed (2.3\u2009kV, positive ion mode) into the mass spectrometer. Specific settings were: full precursor scan m/z\u2009=\u2009370-1700, target value 106\u2009ions, nominal resolution 240,000; up to 10 CID MS/MS fragment spectra/cycle (target value 2000), dynamic exclusion: 30\u2009s, mono-isotopic precursor selection enabled.\nMS data was processed as described above and searched against the UniProt mouse reference database (UP000000589) using PEAKS 11 (Bioinformatics Solutions, Inc.). FDR threshold for identified protein groups was set to 1%; exogenous contaminations (e.g., keratins, trypsin, BSA, IgGs) or proteins identified with less than three specific peptides were not further considered. Label-free quantification of proteins was done as described above; protein abundance was calculated as abundance norm values. To identify target-specific interaction partners, two parameters were calculated from these abundance values for each protein: (i) enrichment in WT versus IgG and target knockout control APs relative to enrichment of the respective AP target protein (target-normalized ratio, tnR and abundance in IgG and target KO control APs relative to the abundance of the respective AP target protein in WT (target-normalized abundance, tnA)). All pairs of AP versus control (4 \u00d73 for TMEM9B and 4 \u00d74 for TMEM9A) were evaluated collectively in t-SNE (for dimensionality reduction) plots using consistency as an additional, stringent criterion using the BELKI software suite (https://github.com/phys2/belki).\nFor determination of phosphorylation sites, Mascot (Server 2.6.2, Matrix Science Ltd) and PEAKS 11 database search results from TMEM9, TMEM9B, and Venus-ClC3 AP-MS datasets were evaluated. Phosphosites were assigned to these target protein sequences only when at least two specific and high-quality phospho-peptide spectra were verified by manual inspection.\nImmunocytochemistry\nCells were seeded on glass coverslips and transfected with PEI or JetPRIME\u00ae (Polyplus). 24\u201348\u2009h after transfection, cells were fixed with methanol or 1% PFA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10\u2009min, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin and blocked in 3% goat serum (NGS), 2% BSA in PBS and incubated overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C with primary antibodies (See Supplementary Table\u00a02) in 0.05% saponin in 3% BSA in PBS. Subsequently, cells were incubated for 1\u2009h at room temperature (RT) with secondary antibodies coupled to different fluorophores and nuclei stained with DAPI, extensively washed, and finally mounted on slides. Images were acquired with a confocal microscope with a 63\u00d7 NA 1.4 oil-immersion lens (LSM880, Zeiss).\nImmunohistochemistry of kidney sections\nAfter deep anesthesia, WT, T9a\u2212/\u2212, T9b\u2212/\u2212, and Clcn5+/\u2212 mice were perfused for 3\u2009min with PBS followed by 3\u2009min with 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS through the left chamber of the heart. Dissected kidneys were post-fixed with 1% PFA overnight and shock-frozen using isopentane on dry ice. 4\u2009\u00b5m-thick kidney cryosections were cut using the CryoStarNX70 (Thermo Fisher) and mounted on microscope slides. Sections were blocked for 2\u2009h with 5% NGS, 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS at RT, and then incubated overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C with primary antibodies (See Supplementary Table\u00a02) in 1% BSA in PBS. After three 10-minute washes with PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100, sections were incubated with secondary antibodies and DAPI in 3% BSA for two hours at RT, washed, and mounted with Fluoromount-G. Images were acquired with the confocal LSM880 microscope.\nLive imaging with lysotracker and lysosensor yellow/blue\nHela WT, T9A, T9B- or T9A/T9B-KO cells or mouse primary embryonic WT and T9A/T9B-KO fibroblasts (MEFs) were seeded on glass-bottom (1.5H) 35-mm live imaging dishes (MatTek). After 18\u201324\u2009h, cells were incubated with 75\u2009nM Lysotracker Red DND-99 (Invitrogen, L7528) in complete DMEM medium for 2\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Nuclei were stained for 5\u2009min with Hoechst, then washed twice with PBS and immediately imaged at 37\u2009\u00b0C at the confocal microscope in prewarmed HBSS buffer. As control, 100\u2009nM Bafilomycin (Sigma) was included in some samples to alkalinize lysosomes.\nFor ClC-3a-induced vacuolization analysis using incubation with Lysosensor\u00aeYellow/Blue DND-160 (Invitrogen, #L7545), non-transfected HeLa cells, or co-transfected with Venus-ClC-3a (WT or mutants) plus T9s (WT or mutants), or CD4 as control, were used. Venus was replaced by mCherry in ClC-3 plasmids when co-expressed with Venus ClC-4 WT or R360S mutant. For confocal imaging, cells were seeded in glass-bottom MatTek imaging dishes. After 48\u2009h transfection, cells were incubated for 15\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C with 5\u2009\u03bcM Lysosensor in complete DMEM medium, then washed twice with PBS and immediately imaged in prewarmed HBSS medium. Cells were imaged with the LSM880 confocal microscope using \u03bbex\u2009=\u2009405\u2009nm and \u03bbem\u2009=\u2009511-588\u2009nm for Lysosensor, and \u03bbex\u2009=\u2009488\u2009nm for Venus.\nDetection of large vacuoles by microscopy\nTo define enlarged vacuoles, we set a minimum size threshold (cross-sectional area >1.0 \u03bcm2 in confocal microscopy). Immunocytochemistry revealed that enlarged vacuoles consistently co-stained with Lamp-2. Each mutant was first examined by live cell imaging using Venus-ClC-3 and Lysosensor fluorescence in a minimum of two independently transfected coverslips. The presence of cells displaying large vesicles was further confirmed in at least three independent experiments of fixed transfected cells in immunocytochemistry using anti-GFP antibodies (to detect Venus-ClC-3) and anti-T9 antibodies (to confirm the co-expression of the T9A or T9B on these vacuoles). Importantly, cells displaying large vacuoles were never observed with 1:1 co-transfection of Venus-GFP and WT T9A or T9B.\nThe percentage of cells displaying >5 large vacuoles was low (\u2009\u2248\u200920\u201325%) on any given coverslip transfected with Venus-ClC-3. The percentage of vacuole-positive cells was lower when partially inhibition-resistant variants of Venus-ClC-3 and T9A or T9B were co-expressed. There appeared to be a rough, positive correlation between the size of vacuoles in individual cells and the number of cells having large vacuoles, which can be taken as rough measure for \u201cefficiency of disinhibition\u201d. For instance, when co-transfected with T9A or T9B, the JK-linker substitution mutant ClC-3JK-C2 led to larger vacuoles, and to a larger number of vacuole-positive cells, than the ClC-3 mutants R418S and even more so than K422G, indicating a lower resistance to inhibition of these single point mutants. This observation correlates with the more quantitative FC analysis: with ClC-3JK-C2 a population of Lysosensor-positive (vacuole-positive) cells was easily detected (Fig.\u00a05a) (which was also the case with CID alanine scanning (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08c). For single point mutants, cells having marked Lysosensor\u00ae fluorescence were hidden in the background of the few cells with high fluorescence that was also observed in non-transfected cells. To detect the low degree of disinhibition observed with human pathogenic mutations, we had to resort exclusively to microscopical analysis. A minimum of 6 images per preparation were acquired and analyzed by ImageJ (FIJI).\nFlow cytometry analysis\nFor flow cytometry (FC), cells were seeded in 6\u2009cm dishes and were transfected as above with Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, #L3000015). After 48\u2009h, cells were harvested with detachment buffer (20\u2009mM EDTA in Ringer\u2019s solution), washed by centrifugation (300\u2009\u00d7\u2009g, 2\u2009min, at RT), and incubated with 5\u2009\u03bcM Lysosensor\u00ae for 15\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C while in suspension in isotonic Ringer\u2019s solution. After washing in Ringer\u2019s solution, cells were resuspended in 5% BSA in Ringer\u2019s solution and analyzed by FC using an LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences).\nData were acquired from a minimum of 50,000 events, and processed by gating as shown in Supplementary. Fig.\u00a08a. GFP expression was detected using a 488\u2009nm laser and 530/30 filter, and Lysosensor fluorescence was measured with a 405\u2009nm laser and 525/50 filter. FlowJo\u2122 software (v10.6.1) was used for data analysis, and fluorescent intensity values were used for quantification. Lysosensor fluorescence was assessed in GFP-(Venus) positive cells. Results are shown as intensity histograms of individual experiments, and mean values of the percentage of \u2018high Lysosensor intensity\u2019 cells from several independent experiments (insets). To obtain this percentage, a bisector tool was used to set a threshold defined as the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) plus two standard deviations (mean + 2\u2009SD). This threshold was determined for the condition in which large vesicles were suppressed, i.e., ClC-3 plus inhibitory T9 protein, or ClC-3 unc or td mutants, and then applied to all conditions in that experimental batch. Data were analyzed in GraphPad Prism (v10.3.1). Nonparametric statistical tests were applied. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the percentage of high Lysosensor intensity cells between control and experimental conditions. Statistical significance was set at p\u2009<\u20090.05. Data are presented as scattered dot plots of mean with SD, and all comparisons were performed using two-tailed tests.\nRatiometric measurement of lysosomal pH\nHela WT or T9A\u2212/\u2212 or T9A\u2212/\u2212/T9B\u2212/\u2212 cells seeded on glass-bottom (1.5H) imaging dishes (MatTek) were loaded overnight with 0.5\u2009mg/ml Oregon Green 488 coupled 10\u2009kDa dextran (Cat. D7170, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in complete medium (DMEM plus 10% FBS) at 37\u2009\u00b0C, and then chased for 2\u2009h. After washing, cells were imaged in imaging buffer containing (in mM): 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, 10 D-glucose, and 25 Hepes pH 7.4 at RT. Images were acquired at \u03bb\u2009=\u2009488 and 435\u2009nm. In situ pH calibration was performed in each sample dish by incubating for 5\u2009min at RT with different pH solutions in the presence of 10\u2009\u03bcM Nigericin (Merck) and 10\u2009\u03bcM Monensin (Merck). Images were acquired using a Nikon Ti Eclipse widefield epifluorescence-TIRF microscope, Prime 95B camera (Teledyne Photometrics), and a PE4000 CoolLed fluorescence lamp with two excitation filters: 436_20 (Zeiss 0440586) and 480_40 (Zeiss 0440583). Images were analyzed using a ComDet v0.5.5 plugin in FIJI Image J.\nSurface expression in Xenopus oocytes\nA previously described luminescence assay was used to detect the surface expression of proteins carrying extracellular HA-tags. Defolliculated oocytes from Xenopus frogs were injected (50\u2009nl/oocyte) with cRNA transcribed from pTLN vectors using mMessage mMachine kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Generally, they were co-injected with 10\u2009ng of ClC-5 and 10\u2009ng of T9s or the non-interacting type I membrane protein CD4 as negative control. To compare the effects of different mutants, oocytes from the same batch were injected with the respective combinations on the same day.\nSurface expression was measured 2\u20133 days after injection. Oocytes were placed for 30\u2009min in ND96 with 1% BSA at 4\u2009\u00b0C to block unspecific binding, incubated for 60\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C with 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (3F10, Roche, in 1% BSA/ND96), washed at 4\u2009\u00b0C, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (goat anti-rat Fab fragments, Jackson ImmunoResearch, in 1% BSA for 30\u201360\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C). Oocytes were washed thoroughly (1% BSA, 4\u2009\u00b0C, 60\u2009min) and transferred to ND96 solution without BSA. Individual oocytes were placed in 50\u2009\u03bcl of Pierce SuperSignal\u2122 ELISA Femto Substrate solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated at RT for 1\u2009min. Chemiluminescence was quantified in a Turner TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Design).\nWestern blot analysis of oocyte extracts\nOocytes previously used for surface expression measurements were pooled and stored at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C. For Western blot analysis, thawed oocytes were homogenized in ice-cold homogenization buffer containing (in mM) 250 sucrose, 0.5 EDTA, 5 Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and protease inhibitor mix (Complete\u00ae, Roche Molecular Biochemicals; and Pefabloc\u00ae, Roth). Egg yolks were removed by three consecutive centrifugation steps at 1,000 \u00d7 g for 2\u2009min each. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay, and equal amounts of protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Protein loading was verified by Ponceau staining.\nExpression levels of HA-tagged proteins were determined using the monoclonal 3F10 antibody (Roche) in Western blots that were quantified using ImageJ/Fiji. Lane intensity profiles were generated and band intensities measured. Protein expression was quantified as area under the curve (AUC) in arbitrary units and normalized to total AUC.\nSurface expression of HA-ClC-5 or HA-T9B was normalized to total protein expression of the respective oocyte samples. Statistical analysis used the Mann\u2013Whitney test with false discovery rate (FDR) correction using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg procedure.\nTwo-electrode voltage clamp in Xenopus oocytes\nPlasma membrane currents were measured in Xenopus oocytes 2\u20133 days after injection using standard two-electrode voltage clamp. Recording pipettes were filled with 3\u2009M KCl. Currents were recorded using a Turbo Tec-03 X voltage clamp amplifier (npi electronics) and pClamp10 software (Molecular Devices).\nCurrents were individually background-subtracted. This proved particularly important for the low currents obtained by HA-ClC-5. Since ClC-5 yields virtually no current between \u2212100 and \u221220\u2009mV (32), currents in this range represent background currents. These were fitted by linear regression individually for each oocyte and a corresponding ohmic current was subtracted individually from each current recording. Water-injected control oocytes ascertained that background currents were ohmic until +80\u2009mV. The few recordings in which tail currents indicated the activation of oocyte Ca2+-activated Cl\u2212 currents at positive potentials were discarded.\nPatch clamp recordings in mammalian cells\nHeLa T9A\u2212/\u2212/T9B\u2212/\u2212 cells on glass coverslips were transfected with Lipofectamine\u2122 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). GFP-ClC-5 (in pEGFP-N1) and non-tagged T9 proteins (in pcDNA3.1) were used for transfection.\nCurrents were recorded 24\u2009h after transfection in whole-cell configuration at room temperature using a MultiClamp 700B patch-clamp amplifier/Digidata 1550B digitizer and pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices). GFP-positive cells were selected for recording. Patch pipette solution was (in mM): 140 CsCl, 5 EGTA, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH). The extracellular solution contained (in mM): 150 NaCl, 6 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, 10 glucose. Series resistance was compensated by 60%. During acquisition, recordings were filtered with a low pass Bessel filter at 4\u2009kHz and sampled at 10\u2009kHz. Voltage step protocol consisted of 0.5\u2009s voltage steps starting from \u2212100 to +140\u2009mV in 20-mV increments from a holding potential of \u221230\u2009mV. Data were analyzed using the Pandas 2.2.2 and SciPy 1.13.1 libraries for Python 3.12 programming language (Python Software Foundation).\nData analysis and statistics\nFor electrophysiology and surface expression, data were analyzed using the Pandas 2.2.2 and SciPy 1.13.1 libraries for Python 3.12 programming language (Python Software Foundation). Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric Mann\u2013Whitney test with false discovery rate corrected using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg procedure.\nEthics statement\nAll animal experiments reported in this work have been performed in accordance to German law, and corresponding permits have been obtained by Landesamt f\u00fcr Gesundheit und Soziales Berlin (LAGeSo).\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.",

        "TITLE": "Molecular determinants for the association of human hormone-sensitive lipase with lipid droplets",
        "ABSTRACT": "Lipid droplets (LDs) are the main cellular storage sites for triacylglycerols (TAGs), playing an important role in energy homeostasis and cell signaling. Hydrolysis of the stored TAGs begins with conversion of TAGs into diacylglycerols (DAGs) by adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), followed by hydrolysis of DAGs by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Despite the central role of HSL in lipolysis, the molecular determinants for its LD association have remained elusive. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of human HSL at 3.4\u2009\u00c5. Combining this with hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, biochemical and cellular assays, we identify residues 489-538, referred to as the \u201cH-motif\u201d, and the N-terminal 4-helix bundle of HSL as LD-binding motifs mediating direct interaction of HSL with LDs. LD binding mediated by the LD-binding motifs is independent of HSL phosphorylation catalyzed by the cAMP-dependent kinase PKA. Our findings provide insight into the LD binding mechanism of HSL, advancing our understanding of the regulation of lipolysis.\nHormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) plays a central role in the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols stored in lipid droplets (LDs). Here, the authors identify two LD-binding motifs in HSL, and the binding is independent of HSL phosphorylation catalyzed by PKA.",
        "INTRO": "Introduction\nLipid droplets (LDs) are organelles found in most cell types, serving as the primary storage sites for neutral lipids such as triacylglycerols (TAGs) and sterol esters (SEs). LDs have a distinctive structure comprising a core of neutral lipids surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer, which differs from the bilayer of other organelles. LDs play a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism and lipid homeostasis. Furthermore, LDs interact with other cellular components, influencing processes like cell signaling and membrane trafficking.\nThe TAGs in LDs are broken down into free fatty acids (FFAs) and glycerol during periods of energy demand. This process, known as lipolysis, is sequentially catalyzed by three neutral lipases, including adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) for hydrolyzing a TAG into diacylglycerols (DAG) and an FFA, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) for hydrolyzing a DAG into monoglycerides (MAG) and an FFA, and monoglyceride lipase (MGL) for hydrolyzing a MAG into glycerol and an FFA.\nHSL was identified together with MGL in 1964 in a study of lipase activities in rat and rabbit adipose tissues. HSL was named because its activity can be stimulated by hormones such as norepinephrine and epinephrine. Since then, a key question is how HSL senses hormones. Much of what we know about the regulation of HSL comes from studies of rat HSL. Hormones can activate protein kinase A (PKA), which is a cAMP-dependent kinase, through the GPCR-G\u03b1s-adenylyl cyclase-cAMP-PKA pathway. The activated PKA catalyzes the phosphorylation of rat HSL at S563, S659, and S660 (refs. ), corresponding to S552, S649, and S650 in human HSL, respectively. Phosphorylation by PKA can increase the enzyme activity of HSL in cell lysates, which could be explained by directly activating HSL and indirectly activating HSL by promoting the association of HSL with LDs.\nActivated PKA is also known to catalyze the phosphorylation of other LD-related proteins, including perilipin 1 (PLIN1), perilipin 5 (PLIN5), ATGL, and CGI-58 (also called ABHD5). PLIN1 is a scaffold protein on LDs and is involved in the recruitment of HSL to LDs. Sztalryd et al. reported that phosphorylation at three serine residues at the N-terminal region of PLIN1 is essential for the recruitment of HSL to LDs in nonadipocyte CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, but Miyoshi et al. demonstrated that PLIN1 mediates the translocation of HSL to LDs independently of PLIN1 phosphorylation in MEF (murine embryonic fibroblasts) adipocytes. The controversial conclusions regarding the role of PLIN1 phosphorylation in the recruitment of HSL to LDs may be due to different cell lines that were used in the two studies. However, both studies suggest an important role of PLIN1 in the regulation of LD binding of HSL.\nIt has been reported that without hormone stimulation, HSL can already bind to LDs, with the binding ratio varying in different studies. In adipocytes from young male rats, the LD binding ratio increased from about 40% to 80% after isoproterenol stimulation; but in mature male rats, the ratio remained less than 20% regardless of isoproterenol stimulation. Another study also reported that in adipocytes from young male rats, the LD-binding ratio of HSL increased from 60% to 80% after being stimulated with various hormones. Inside the rat muscle fiber, the binding ratio increased from 30% to 42% after epinephrine stimulation and further increased to 59% after muscle contraction. These studies provided evidence that HSL associates with LDs in its basal state, and the association can be further stimulated by hormones in a context-dependent manner. However, the molecular basis for the association of HSL with LDs is unclear.\nIn this study, we find that HSL can directly associate with LDs through a short sequence in its regulatory domain and a 4-helix bundle in its N-terminal domain. We determine the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of human HSL at 3.4\u2009\u00c5 resolution and analyze the structural changes induced by LDs binding using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). Using an in vitro reconstituted artificial lipid droplet (ALD) binding assay and a cellular imaging assay, we find that the regulatory domain (residues 489-659) of HSL is\u00a0essential to its LD-binding ability. We then narrow down the LD-binding sequence to residues 489 to 538 and define this sequence as the \u201cH-motif\u201d. Deletion or mutations of the H-motif decrease the enzymatic activity of HSL towards a long acyl chain substrate but have no influence on the hydrolysis of pNPB, a short acyl chain substrate. Additionally, we identify a 4-helix bundle (residues 1-136) in the N-terminal domain of HSL as another LD-binding motif in HSL.\nWe further investigate the importance of the LD-binding motifs in the context of PKA activation in both 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes. Our results demonstrate that forskolin-induced PKA activation \u00a0increases HSL phosphorylation levels independently of the LD-binding status of HSL. The LD-binding motifs are essential for HSL binding to LDs, regardless of PKA activation. Notably, PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of HSL does not affect its LD-binding ability in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes but enhances HSL localization to LDs in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These findings suggest that, in addition to interactions mediated by the LD-binding motifs, which are independent of PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation, HSL localizes to LDs also through PKA-dependent interactions in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Additionally, we find that phosphorylation has no impact on the enzymatic activity or LD-binding ability of purified HSL, indicating that PKA may not directly modulate HSL\u2019s enzymatic activity or LD binding but may indirectly facilitate HSL localization to LDs in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.",
        "RESULTS": "Results\nHSL interacts with artificial lipid droplets\nHSL has three major isoforms: HSLtes, HSLbeta, and HSLadi, which are expressed in the testis, insulin-secreting \u03b2-cells, and adipocytes, respectively. The HSL in our study refers to the adipocyte isoform of human HSL (UniProt: Q05469-2), which contains only residues 302-1076 of the testis isoform.\nWe overexpressed human HSL, which contains an N-terminal domain, a catalytic domain, and a regulatory domain inserted in the catalytic domain (Fig.\u00a01a), in Expi293F cells and purified it to homogeneity (Fig.\u00a01b). The enzyme activity of the purified HSL was first evaluated using p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) as the substrate. The Km and kcat are 186.1\u2009\u00b5M and 124.5\u2009s-1, respectively (Fig.\u00a01c). HSL lost its activity when its catalytic residue S424 was mutated to alanine (Fig.\u00a01c). The enzyme activity of HSL was also evaluated using the EnzChek lipase substrate (Invitrogen), which is a fluorogenic analog of TAG. Only the wild-type (WT) HSL, but not the S424A mutant, hydrolyzed the EnzChek lipase substrate (Fig.\u00a01d). These results confirm that the purified HSL is functional.\nNext, we evaluated the LD-binding ability of HSL using a flotation assay. We prepared artificial lipid droplets (ALDs) by mixing 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) with TAG following a method reported previously. Since the phospholipid monolayer of mammalian LDs mainly consists of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) with a molar ratio of around 3:1 (ref. ), we also prepared ALDs by mixing DOPC and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) (DOPC:DOPE\u2009=\u20093:1) with TAG (Fig.\u00a01e). We first incubated the purified HSL with ALDs or the same volume of an assay buffer, then separated the ALD-bound HSL from unbound HSL using sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig.\u00a01f). After centrifugation, we collected three fractions named top, middle and bottom fractions. ALDs were enriched in the top fraction (Fig.\u00a01f). In the absence of ALDs, HSL was mainly in the bottom fraction, while in the presence of ALDs, HSL was mainly in the top fraction (Fig.\u00a01g). As a control, a soluble protein maltose-binding protein (MBP) was mainly in the bottom fraction no matter in the absence or presence of ALDs (Fig.\u00a01g). We qualified HSL in the top fraction under different conditions and found that in the presence of ALDs prepared using the DOPC and DOPE mixture, about 80% of HSL was in the top fraction. In contrast, under the same conditions, less than 10% of MBP was in the top fraction (Fig.\u00a01h). These results demonstrate that HSL can directly bind to ALDs. This finding is consistent with a previous report that HSL purified from rat adipose tissue can be incorporated into phosphatidylcholine vesicles.\nCryo-EM structure of human HSL\nTo understand how HSL binds to LDs, we attempted to solve the cryo-EM structure of HSL bound to ALDs but were unsuccessful. Instead, we solved the cryo-EM structure of HSL in the absence of ALDs. Before preparing the cryo-EM samples, we incubated HSL with HSL-IN-1, an inhibitor of HSL. The cryo-EM map has an overall resolution of 3.4\u2009\u00c5 (Supplementary Table\u00a01; Supplementary Figs.\u00a01 & 2). The N-terminal domain and the catalytic domain were resolved in the cryo-EM map, while the majority of the regulatory domain (residues 492-637) was unresolved (Fig.\u00a02a, b). The HSL inhibitor HSL-IN-1 was not observed in the cryo-EM map. The cryo-EM structure reveals a homodimeric state of HSL (Fig.\u00a02b). Based on the homodimeric structure, the N-terminal domain is defined as residues 1-174, which contains a 4-helix bundle (residues 1-136). The catalytic domain is divided into three subdomains: CD1, consisting of residues 175-262; CD2, consisting of residues 263-488; and CD3, consisting of residues 660-775 (Fig.\u00a02a, b).\nThe N-terminal 4-helix bundle from one HSL protomer contacts with the CD2 subdomain from the other protomer at the dimer interface (Fig.\u00a02c). In addition, the CD1 subdomains from the two HSL protomers (Fig.\u00a02d) also contact with each other at the dimer interface. The residues between N198 and R214 in CD1 were not resolved in the cryo-EM map.\nSeveral crystal structures of bacterial homologs of human HSL have been reported. These bacterial homologs share a conserved catalytic domain. Unlike human HSL, they do not contain the N-terminal domain and the regulatory domain. We aligned the catalytic domain of human HSL with the crystal structure of EST2 (PDB: 1QZ3), which is a carboxylesterase from the thermophilic eubacterium Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius. CD2 and CD3 in HSL are highly similar to those in EST2 (Fig.\u00a02e). The three residues forming the catalytic triad of human HSL, including S424, D693, and H723, are located in CD2 and CD3 and align well with those in EST2 (Fig.\u00a02e), indicating a conserved catalytic mechanism of HSL across different species. In contrast, the CD1 subdomain shows significant differences (Fig.\u00a02e), which may explain why the homodimeric structure of HSL has not been observed in its bacterial homologs.\nIn the structure of EST2, a 1-hexadecanesulfonyl group, which mimics the substrate of EST2, is covalently linked to the catalytic serine residue (Fig.\u00a02e). The tail of the long acyl chain docks into a pocket formed by a region analogous to CD1 in human HSL, suggesting that CD1 may be involved in the recognition of the acyl chains in DAGs by human HSL.\nThe regulatory domain is the dominant LD-binding region in HSL\nIn the cryo-EM structure, three internal regions, including residues 199\u2013213, 325\u2013336, and the regulatory domain (residues 489\u2013659), are largely invisible, probably due to their inherent flexibility. To understand the roles of these regions in the LD-binding ability and enzymatic activity of HSL, we engineered HSL variants in which these regions were deleted and subsequently overexpressed in Expi293F cells. We successfully purified two variants, namely HSL(\u0394325\u2013333) and HSL(\u0394489\u2013659), where residues 325\u2013333 and residues 489-659 were deleted, respectively. We also purified a variant, HSL(\u0394\u0394), which had both residues 325\u2013333 and residues 489-659 deleted. However, we failed to obtain well-behaved HSL with residues 198\u2013214 deleted.\nWe evaluated whether these HSL variants can still bind to the ALDs using the flotation assay (Fig.\u00a03a). Deletion of residues 325-333 only slightly decreased the binding of HSL to ALDs; in contrast, deletion of residues 489-659 significantly decreased the ratio of HSL bound to ALDs (Fig.\u00a03a, b). These results indicate that residues 489-659 are essential for LD binding.\nWe also measured the enzymatic activities of these HSL variants. When pNPB was used as the substrate, the activities of these variants were close to that of the full-length HSL (Fig.\u00a03c). However, when the EnzChek lipase substrate was used, HSL(\u0394489\u2013659) showed significantly decreased activity, while HSL(\u0394325\u2013333) showed an activity similar to that of HSL(FL) (Fig.\u00a03d).\nNext, we checked the subcellular localization of HSL(FL) and HSL(\u0394489\u2013659) in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by fusing an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) to their C-termini and transiently expressing them in the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes are a mouse cell line used to study fat cell formation and lipid accumulation. The LDs in the cells were stained with LipidTOX Deep Red. The full-length HSL was expressed in the cytosol and showed an obvious accumulation around the LDs (Fig.\u00a03e, top; Fig.\u00a03f). In contrast, HSL(\u0394489\u2013659) was widely distributed in the cytosol but not accumulated around the LDs (Fig.\u00a03e, middle; Fig.\u00a03f). Residues 489-659 alone with an EGFP fusing to its C-terminus accumulated on the LDs when transiently expressed in the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (Fig.\u00a03e, bottom; Fig.\u00a03f). Similar results were also observed when we stably expressed these EGFP-fusion proteins in Huh-7 cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03), a human liver cancer cell line frequently used to study lipid metabolism. These results are consistent with our findings in the flotation assay, which suggest that the regulatory domain (residues 489\u2013659) is necessary and sufficient for the LD binding of HSL.\nIdentification of LD-binding regions in HSL using HDX-MS\nTo identify which regions in HSL are involved in binding with LDs, we also used hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). HDX-MS measures the exchange rates of hydrogen atoms in protein amide groups with deuterium in the solvent. Amide hydrogens involved in hydrogen bonds or buried away from the solvent exchange more slowly than those in flexible or solvent-accessible regions. Therefore, HDX-MS is widely used in the study of protein conformational changes and interactions involving proteins. The purified HSL was first mixed with the ALDs or the same volume of the assay buffer, then diluted with the same buffer prepared with D2O to initiate the hydrogen-deuterium exchange. After 5, 30, or 600\u2009s, the exchange was stopped by adding a quench buffer. The quenched sample was digested by pepsin online and subjected to UPLC/MS analysis (Fig.\u00a04a; Supplementary Tables\u00a02 & 3).\nAt each time point, we calculated the deuterium incorporation ratio for each digested peptide generated from both the ALD-bound and the ALD-free HSL samples (Fig.\u00a04b; Supplementary Figs.\u00a04 & 5). The region containing residues 480-640, which almost covers the whole regulatory domain, showed higher deuterium incorporation ratios than other regions in both samples. This finding is consistent with the cryo-EM data the predicted secondary structure of the regulatory domain, which mainly consists of a long flexible and unstructured loop (Fig.\u00a04b). We then subtracted the deuterium incorporation ratios of the ALD-free HSL sample from these of the ALD-bound sample to quantify the changes in deuterium incorporation ratios upon ALD binding, and mapped these changes onto the structure of full-length HSL predicted by AlphaFold2 (ref. ) (Fig.\u00a04c). The AlphaFold2-predicted structure closely resembles the structure of each protomer in the cryo-EM structure of the HSL dimer (Fig.\u00a02), but contains flexible regions that are invisible in the cryo-EM structure. Notably, the regulatory domain of HSL exhibited higher changes compared to other regions, with the most significant changes observed in an \u03b1-helix comprising residues 511\u2013535 (Fig.\u00a04c). These results are consistent with our finding that the regulatory domain is essential for LD binding, and suggest that the region containing residues 511\u2013535 may be the core of the LD-binding region.\nIn addition, the HDX-MS data show that the deuterium incorporation ratios of certain peptides from the N-terminal 4-helix bundle decreased by more than 10% upon ALD binding. This suggests that the N-terminal 4-helix bundle may also be involved in the binding of HSL to lipid droplets.\nIdentification of the LD-binding motif in the HSL regulatory domain\nTo evaluate the findings from the HDX-MS data, and to identify the core region that is responsible for the LD-binding ability of the regulatory domain, we fused different truncations of the regulatory domain to the C-terminus of MBP (Fig.\u00a05a), overexpressed them in E. coli, and purified them to homogeneity. We designed these constructs because residues 489-509 and residues 510-535 are predicted as two \u03b1-helices, while residues 536-659 are predicted as a flexible loop by AlphaFold2 (ref. ).\nWe compared the LD-binding abilities of these fusion proteins with that of MBP alone using the flotation assay (Fig.\u00a05b). We found that MBP fused with residues 489-659 of HSL, named MBP-HSL(489-659), had an ALD-binding ratio of about 30%. The ALD-binding ratio of MBP-HSL(489-538) was about 25%, slightly lower than that of MBP-HSL(489-659). In contrast, the ALD-binding ratio of MBP-HSL(539-659) was only about 8%, which is similar to that of MBP alone (Fig.\u00a05b, c). MBP fused to a shorter construct, either residues 489-509 or residues 509-538, showed a significantly decreased ALD-binding ratio (Fig.\u00a05b, c).\nWe then deleted residues 489\u2013538 from HSL, referred to as HSL(\u0394489\u2013538), and tested its ability to bind to the ALDs using the flotation assay (Fig.\u00a05d, e). The ALD-binding ratio decreased from 76% for HSL(FL) to 32% for HSL(\u0394489\u2013538). When transiently expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, HSL(\u0394489\u2013538) with an EGFP fused to its C-terminus lost the ability to bind to LDs (Fig.\u00a05f, middle; Fig.\u00a05g), in comparison with the HSL(FL)-EGFP fusion protein (Fig.\u00a05f, top; Fig.\u00a05g). In contrast, residues 489-538 fused with EGFP was accumulated around LDs in the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (Fig.\u00a05f, bottom; Fig.\u00a05g).\nTaken together, our data suggest that residues 489\u2013538 of the regulatory domain are the LD-binding motif in the HSL regulatory domain. We named this motif the \u201cH-motif\u201d.\nAromatic residues in the H-motif are essential for LD binding\nWe further checked which residues in the H-motif are involved in LD binding. Previous studies reveal that membrane-binding motifs are typically rich in hydrophobic or amphipathic amino acids, allowing them to interact with the phospholipid layer. We first focused on residues 511-535 since our HDX-MS data suggest that this sequence may be the core of the LD-binding motif. According to the structure of the H-motif predicted by AlphaFold2 (ref. ), three aromatic residues, including F519, W526, and F530, line up on the same side of the H-motif; while two positively charged residues, R517 and R520, are on the other side (Fig.\u00a06a). We aligned the protein sequences of HSL from different species, and found that the H-motif is highly conserved in species ranging from human to mice; residues 508-532 are also conserved in Xenopus tropicalis and Danio rerio (Fig.\u00a06b).\nWe fused the wild-type human H-motif and its mutants to the C-terminus of MBP and overexpressed them in E. coli. The MBP fused with the WT H-motif, or with H-motifs carrying mutations F519V/W526V/F530V, F519A/W526A/F530A, and R517A/R520A, is named MBP-WT, MBP-3V, MBP-3A, and MBP-R2A, respectively. The LD-binding abilities of the purified proteins were evaluated using the flotation assay. We found that MBP-R2A had a similar ALD-binding ratio to that of MBP-WT, but MBP-3V and MBP-3A showed significantly decreased ALD-binding ratios (Fig.\u00a06c, d), indicating that the three aromatic residues, but not the two arginine residues, are essential for LD binding. We also confirmed the importance of the three aromatic residues by testing the LD-binding ability of the H-motif when it\u2019s fused to EGFP and transiently expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Mutating the three aromatic residues to alanine or valine almost completely disrupted the ability of the H-motif to bind to LDs (Fig.\u00a06e, f).\nThe N-terminal 4-helix bundle is also an LD-binding motif in HSL\nThe HDX-MS data suggest that the N-terminal 4-helix bundle (residues 1\u2013136) of HSL may also contribute to its LD-binding ability. We fused the 4-helix bundle to the C-terminus of MBP and found that this 4-helix bundle significantly increased the ALD-binding ratio of MBP (Fig.\u00a07a, b).\nUpon examining the AlphaFold2 predicted structure, we identified an amphipathic loop containing residues 97 to 103 (RRSIFFR) within this 4-helix bundle (Fig.\u00a07c). We hypothesized that two hydrophobic residues, I100 and F101, in this loop are essential for the lipid droplet-binding ability of the 4-helix bundle. To test this, we introduced the I100A and F101A double mutations into HSL to generate the HSL mutant HSL(I100A/F101A), and introduced the H-motif mutations (F519A/W526A/F530A) into HSL to generate HSL(FL, 3A). By further combining the I100A and F101A mutations with the H-motif mutations, we generated another HSL mutant, HSL(FL, 5A). We found that the ALD-binding ratio of HSL(I100A/F101A) was significantly decreased compared to the wild-type HSL, and the ALD-binding ratio of HSL(FL, 5A) was even lower than that of HSL(I100A/F101A) (Fig.\u00a07d, e). We also checked the LD-binding ability of these HSL mutants in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and the results are consistent with the ALD-binding results (Fig.\u00a07f, g). These findings indicate that in addition to the H-motif, the N-terminal 4-helix bundle is also an LD-binding motif of HSL.\nLD-binding motifs but not phosphorylation determine LD binding of HSL in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes\nPhosphorylation is known to regulate the activity of HSL. Human HSL can be phosphorylated at S552, S649, and S650 by PKA, and phosphorylated at S554 by AMPK (corresponding to S565 in rat HSL. Upon treating 3T3-L1 adipocyte cells with isoproterenol (an agonist of \u03b2 adrenoceptor) to promote cAMP production to activate PKA, rat HSL was reported to translocate from the cytosol to LDs, and mutating S659 and S660 of HSL to alanine blocked this translocation.\nWe first tested the effect of PKA activation on the subcellular localization of HSL in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. We transiently expressed human HSL with an EGFP fused to its C-terminus in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and then treated the cells with forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclases to promote cAMP production. Without forskolin treatment, HSL had already accumulated around the LDs, and forskolin treatment did not noticeably increase the accumulation (Fig.\u00a08a, top; Fig.\u00a08b). The phosphorylation of HSL, induced by forskolin treatment, was verified by Western blot (Fig.\u00a08c). Consistent with this finding, we found that the S552A/S649A/S650A triple mutant and the S552A/554A/S649A/S650A quadruple mutant of human HSL maintained the ability to accumulate on the LDs in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06a). In addition, the S552E/S554E/S649E/S650E quadruple mutant, which mimics the phosphorylated state of HSL, showed an ALD-binding ability similar to that of the S552A/S554A/S649A/S650A quadruple mutant in the flotation assay (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06b, c). We also evaluated the effect of phosphorylation on the LD-binding ability of HSL using purified dephosphorylated and phosphorylated HSL (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07a, b), and found that phosphorylation had little effect on the ALD-binding ability of human HSL (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07c\u2013e).\nWe have identified that both the H-motif and the N-terminal 4-helix bundle are essential for the LD-binding ability of HSL. Deletion or mutation of either region can disrupt the colocalization of HSL with LDs (Figs.\u00a05 & 7). To test whether LD-binding plays a role in the regulation of HSL by phosphorylation, we transiently expressed EGFP-fused wild-type HSL and its variants in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and treated the cells with forskolin. Firstly, we confirmed that regardless of forskolin treatment, the HSL(FL, 3A) and HSL(FL, 5A) mutants could not accumulate on LDs (Fig.\u00a08a, b). Similar results were observed when we fused mBaojin, a bright and stable monomeric GFP derived from StayGold, to the C-termini of wild-type HSL, HSL(\u0394489-538), and HSL(FL, 3A) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08). We also checked the effect of forskolin-induced phosphorylation on the subcellular localization of HSL in HEK 293T and Huh-7 cells, and the results are similar to these in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (Supplementary Figs.\u00a09 and 10). Secondly, we found that both HSL(FL, 3A) and HSL(FL, 5A) had similar phosphorylation levels as the wild-type HSL when transiently expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and their phosphorylation levels were increased upon forskolin treatment (Fig.\u00a08c). These results suggest that the LD-binding motifs are necessary for the binding of HSL to LDs but not for the phosphorylation of HSL in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.\nWe also checked the effect of phosphorylation on the enzymatic activity of HSL using in vitro assays. We have shown that deletion of the regulatory domain decreased the activity of HSL to hydrolyze the EnzChek lipase substrate (Fig.\u00a03d) but not the pNPB substrate (Fig.\u00a03c). In consistent with this finding, deletion of the H-motif, or mutation of F519/W526/F530 to alanine or valine, affected the enzymatic activity of HSL in a similar way (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07f, g). But phosphorylation showed minimal effect on the activity of HSL to hydrolyze the EnzChek lipase substrate (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07h, i) or DAG (1,2 Dioleoyl-rac-glycerol), a natural substrate of HSL (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07j, k). These findings indicate that phosphorylation has minimal effect on the enzymatic activity of purified HSL.\nH-motif and phosphorylation independently influence the LD binding of HSL in 3T3-L1 adipocytes\nThe results from the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes assay are consistent with those from the ALD-binding assay. However, the LDs in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes lack certain components, such as PLIN1, compared to 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Therefore, we next examined the roles of the H-motif and phosphorylation in regulating the LD-binding ability of HSL in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig.\u00a09).\nFirstly, we found that the colocalization of HSL(FL, WT) with LDs was enhanced upon forskolin treatment (Fig.\u00a09a, top; Fig.\u00a09b); such an enhancement was observed even when the H-motif was deleted (Fig.\u00a09a, middle; Fig.\u00a09b) but was absent when three phosphorylation sites (S552/S649/S650) in HSL were mutated to alanine (Fig.\u00a09a, bottom; Fig.\u00a09b). Western blot analysis confirmed increased phosphorylation levels of both HSL(FL, WT) and the H-motif deleted mutant following forskolin treatment (Fig.\u00a09c). These observations suggest that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of HSL promotes its localization to LDs, independent of the H-motif.\nSecondly, we found that deletion of the H-motif significantly reduced the colocalization of HSL with LDs, regardless of forskolin treatment (Fig.\u00a09a, b). Moreover, the H-motif deletion did not affect forskolin-induced phosphorylation of HSL at S650 (Fig.\u00a09c). These results indicate that the H-motif facilitates HSL localization to LDs in a phosphorylation-independent manner and does not influence PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of HSL.\nTo understand the differences between the results from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and those from 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we focused on PLIN1. We confirmed that the mRNA level of PLIN1 was very low in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes but significantly increased upon differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011a). Previous studies have reported that PLIN1 is a scaffold protein on LDs and can recruit HSL to LDs, and this recruitment is regulated by PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of PLIN1. We examined the effect of PLIN1 on the LD-binding ability of HSL using the in vitro floatation assay. Unexpectedly, we found that PLIN1, in both its unphosphorylated and phosphorylated states, decreased the ALD-binding ability of purified HSL (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011 b-i). These findings suggest that PLIN1, at least by itself, cannot explain the phosphorylation-dependent localization of HSL to LDs in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.",
        "DISCUSS": "Discussion\nWe have identified the H-motif and the N-terminal 4-helix bundle of HSL as two LD-binding motifs of HSL, providing evidence that HSL can directly bind to LDs in the absence of the LD scaffold protein PLIN1 and elucidating the molecular mechanism for the LD binding of HSL. Though the possibility that HSL may be recruited to LDs through interactions with other LD-bound proteins cannot be excluded, our findings reveal that direct binding, mediated by the LD-binding motifs, is essential for the localization of HSL to LDs and may explain the LD binding of HSL in its basal state.\nWe have demonstrated that in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, the binding of HSL to LDs is predominantly attributed to interactions mediated by the LD-binding motifs and is not affected by PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation (Fig.\u00a08). In contrast, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation enhances HSL localization to LDs independently of the H-motif-mediated LD binding. The results in 3T3-L1 adipocytes are consistent with previous studies showing that phosphorylation of HSL by PKA induced the translocation of HSL from the cytosol to LDs. However, the H-motif remains essential for the localization of HSL to LDs in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, as its deletion significantly decreases the colocalization of HSL with LDs, regardless of PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation (Fig.\u00a09). Taken together, these findings suggest that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, HSL localizes to LDs through two distinct mechanisms: one dependent on PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation and the other mediated by the LD-binding motifs, which operates independently of PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation.\nWe have demonstrated that phosphorylation had minimal effects on the enzymatic activity of purified HSL and on the LD-binding ability of both purified HSL and HSL expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (Supplementary Figs.\u00a06\u201310). These findings suggest that the observed enhancement of HSL localization to LDs in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, induced by forskolin treatment, may not be a direct effect of PKA-catalyzed HSL phosphorylation. Other factors present in 3T3-L1 adipocytes but not in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes may be involved in this enhancement. PLIN1 appears to be such a factor, given that previous studies have reported that phosphorylated PLIN1 can recruit HSL to LDs. However, our in vitro data showed that both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated PLIN1 negatively affect the LD-binding ability of purified HSL (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011 b-i). Thus, we propose that additional factors beyond PLIN1 are likely involved and remain to be identified.\nTwo types of motifs have been identified to directly associate with LDs in previous studies. One is amphipathic \u03b1 helices, which undergo conformational changes from a disordered structure to an amphipathic \u03b1 helix upon association with the membrane. These amphipathic \u03b1-helices align parallel to the membrane surface when they associate with it. The other is hydrophobic regions, usually hydrophobic hairpins, that insert into the membrane. The H-motif identified in our study is predicted by AlphaFold2 to form two short helices connected by two arginine residues (Fig.\u00a06). A recent study reported that a hairpin structure adopts a shallow open-V shape conformation when it associates with the phospholipid monolayer of LDs. We speculate that the H-motif may be associated with LDs through a mechanism similar to that of hydrophobic hairpins. Regarding the N-terminal 4-helix bundle of HSL, the other LD-binding motif identified in our study, it may be classified into hydrophobic regions and may interact with LDs through one end of the 4-helix bundle structure, which contains an amphipathic loop (residues 97 to 103: RRSIFFR) (Figs.\u00a04 & 7). Further studies to figure out the coordination between the H-motif and the N-terminal 4-helix bundle when they bind to LDs, as well as the effects of the LD-binding on the overall structure of HSL, are important for understanding the functional mechanism of HSL.\nPrevious studies suggest that HSL can form homodimers. Shen et al. reported that the HSL from rat adipose tissue formed homodimers, and the enzymatic activity of dimeric HSL was about 40-fold higher than that of monomeric HSL. Krintel et al. reported that all three isoforms of HSL recombinantly expressed in insect cells mainly formed head-to-head homodimers in the negative stain electron microscopy (EM) images. In our study, we have determined the cryo-EM structure of human HSL, in which HSL forms a homodimer, but the dimers are assembled by two HSL protomers through head-to-tail interactions (Fig.\u00a02b\u2013d). The CD1 subdomain of HSL, which is less conserved in bacterial homologs of human HSL, is located at the center of the HSL homodimer (Fig.\u00a02b, d). Structural alignment suggests that the CD1 subdomain may interact with the acyl chains of its natural substrates, DAGs (Fig.\u00a02e). However, the formation of the homodimer seems to block access to the catalytic residue S424 of HSL (Fig.\u00a02e). In addition, the key residues in the 4-helix bundle, which mediate the LD-binding of HSL, are buried by the dimer interface, indicating that the dimer may dissociate upon binding to LDs. One possibility is that the observed homodimer in the cryo-EM structure represents an inactive state of HSL, and binding of HSL to LDs may dissociate the homodimer, thereby activating HSL. Further studies are required to test this hypothesis.",

The expressed constructs each have an N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) tag followed by a DrICE cleavage site. For cell assays, the gene encoding adipocyte HSL with an N-terminal FLAG tag and a C-terminal EGFP was cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate the expression constructs of HSL variants.\nExpression and purification of human HSL, HSL variants, and PLIN1\nThe plasmid of Human HSL in the pCAGGS vector was transfected in Expi293F cells (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured in SMM 293-TI Expression Medium (Sino Biological) at 37\u2009\u00b0C with 5% CO2 to a density of 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells per mL. For 0.8\u2009L cell culture, 1.5\u2009mg of HSL(FL) plasmid was pre-mixed and transfected with 3\u2009mg of polyethylenimines (PEIs, Polysciences). The transfected cells were cultured for 58\u2009h, then harvested by centrifugation at 3000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 10\u2009min and resuspended in a lysis buffer (25\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 5% Glycerol, 5\u2009mM ATP, 5\u2009mM MgCl2) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (1.3\u2009\u03bcg/mL aprotinin, 5\u2009\u03bcg/mL leupeptin, 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL pepstatin). The cells were lysed by incubating with 1.0% n-Dodecyl-\u03b2-D-Maltopyranoside (DDM) at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009h. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 20,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 1\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C, then the supernatant was collected and incubated with anti-FLAG tag affinity resin (GenScript. Inc. Cat. No.: L00432-25) at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009h. After washing the beads with buffer A (25\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 5% Glycerol, 0.02% DDM), and buffer B (25\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 5% Glycerol, 0.02% DDM, 5\u2009mM ATP, 5\u2009mM MgCl2), the target protein was eluted using buffer A plus 0.4\u2009mg/mL FLAG peptide (EveryLab, Cat No:PF01-50). The eluate was concentrated and further purified by gel filtration (Superdex 200 increase, 10/30, GE Healthcare) with a running buffer containing 25\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, and 0.01% GDN. The peak fractions were collected and used for cryo-EM sample preparation and biochemical assays. The PLIN1 and the HSL variants each have a C-terminal FLAG tag and were expressed and purified following the same protocol, except that the eluate of PLIN1 was concentrated and purified by gel filtration (Superdex 200 increase, 10/30, GE Healthcare) with a running buffer containing 25\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 0.02% DDM, and 0.002% cholesteryl hemisuccinate Tris salt (CHS, Anatrace).\nExpression and purification of MBP and MBP fusion proteins\nThe plasmids of MBP and MBP fusion proteins in the modified pET15d vector were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. The transformed cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL ampicillin at 37\u2009\u00b0C until OD600 reached 0.8\u20131.0, and then cooled to 18\u2009\u00b0C followed by the addition of 0.5\u2009mM \u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The cells were cultured at 18\u2009\u00b0C for additional 15\u2009h, and then harvested by centrifugation at 4000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 10\u2009min and resuspended in a lysis buffer (25\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 5% Glycerol, 1\u2009mM DTT). After adding the protease inhibitor PMSF (1\u2009mM), the cells were immediately disrupted by ultrasonication. The cell lysate was incubated with 1% DDM for 1\u2009h, and then centrifuged at 20,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 1\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The supernatant was incubated with MBP Resin (Dextrin Beads, Smart-Lifescience, Cat. No.: SA077025) at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009h, then the resin was washed with a wash buffer (25\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 5% Glycerol, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 1\u2009mM DTT, 0.02% DDM). The protein was eluted from the resin with an elution buffer B (25\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 5% Glycerol, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 1\u2009mM DTT, 0.02% DDM, 10\u2009mM maltose). The eluate was concentrated and further purified by gel filtration (Superdex 200 increase, 10/30, GE Healthcare) with a running buffer containing 25\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, and 0.01% GDN. The peak fractions were pooled and concentrated and then used for flotation assay.\nHydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry\n80\u2009\u00b5L of purified HSL (17.8\u2009\u00b5M in 25\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl) was incubated for 1\u2009h at room temperature with 40\u2009\u00b5L of ALDs (OD600\u2009=\u200921.98) in an assay buffer (25\u2009mM HEPES pH7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl) or with 40\u2009\u00b5L of the assay buffer without ALDs. The HDX reactions were initiated by adding 34\u2009\u03bcL of labeling buffer (25\u2009mM HEPES, 150\u2009mM NaCl in D2O, pD\u2009=\u20097.4) to 6\u2009\u03bcL of the HSL sample, giving a final concentration of 85% D2O. The exchange reaction was carried out for 0, 5, 30, and 600\u2009s (each time point was carried out in triplicate). The reaction was quenched by adding 40\u2009\u00b5L of quench buffer (0.7\u2009M guanidine-HCl, 1.05% Formic acid) on ice. Then 65\u2009\u03bcL of each sample was rapidly injected into a M-class UPLC system with HDX manager (Waters) and run over an Enzymate BEH Pepsin column (Waters, 2.1\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009mm, 5\u2009\u03bcm) at 15\u2009\u00b0C with a flowrate of 100\u2009\u03bcL/min for 4\u2009min. The digested peptic peptides were trapped into a VanGuard precolumn (Waters, 2.1\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009mm, 1.7\u2009\u03bcm) and subsequently separated by an in-line Acquity BEH C18 UPLC column (Waters, 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009100\u2009mm, 1.7\u2009\u03bcm). The mobile phases were 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B). The gradient of mobile phase B was increased from 2% to 35% in 6\u2009min, with a flow rate of 50\u2009\u03bcL/min. It was then held at 35% for 1\u2009min and further increased to 85% in 0.5\u2009min. After being held at 85% for 1\u2009min, the gradient was decreased to 2% in 0.5\u2009min and maintained for the post-equilibration. Mass spectra were acquired on a Synapt XS mass spectrometer (Waters) using an electrospray ionization source operated at 80\u2009\u00b0C and a spray voltage of 3.0\u2009kV. The mass range was from 50 to 2000\u2009m/z. The MSE method was used for peptide fragmentation and mapping (Low trap collision energy of 4\u2009V and High ramp trap collision energy of 20\u201345\u2009V).\nAccording to the guidelines, the summary of the HDX-MS experiment details was presented in Supplementary Table\u00a02. The peptide mapping was performed using ProteinLynX Global Server 3.03 software from Waters, with the processing parameters detailed in Supplementary Table\u00a03. Then, the peptides were filtered upon importing into DynamX with these parameters: the Minimum intensity is 1481; the Minimum and Maximum sequence lengths are 3 and 0, respectively; the Minimum products is 2; the Minimum products per amino acid is 0.11; the consecutive products is 1; the Minimum sum intensity for products is 472; the Minimum score is 6.62; the Maximum MH+ error(ppm) is 10; the Replication-File threshold is 3. Next, the deuterium incorporation of each peptic peptide was automatically annotated using the DynamX. All peptides were manually inspected for correct charge state, correct retention time, and appropriate selection of isotopic distribution. The fully denatured HSL protein served as the maximally labeled control, with an average back-exchange degree of 29.87%. The deuterium incorporation ratios of the ALD-free HSL sample were subtracted from those of the ALD-bound sample to calculate the changes in deuterium incorporation ratios upon LD binding. These changes were mapped onto the structure of full-length HSL predicted by AlphaFold2. Following a protocol described, differences in exchange in a peptide were considered significant if they met all three of the following criteria: >\u00a05% change in exchange, >\u00a00.4\u2009Da mass difference in exchange, and a P-value\u2009\u2264\u20090.01 using a two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test.\nMeasurement of the HSL activity using the EnzChek lipase substrate\nThe assay was done by following the protocol in a previous study with slight changes. Specifically, the EnzChek lipase substrate (Invitrogen, REF E33955) was prepared as a 100\u2009\u00b5M stock in DMSO. The stock was diluted to 0.75\u2009\u00b5M using a reaction buffer containing 25\u2009mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, and 1.5% fatty acid-free BSA (GOLDBIO, CAS: 9048-46-8). 20\u2009\u00b5L of the diluted EnzChek lipase substrate was mixed with 5\u2009\u03bcL of HSL (100\u2009nM) in 25\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, and 0.01% GDN in a black 384-well plate (Corning, REF 3575) at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The fluorescence signals were immediately monitored in a microplate reader (Spark) with an excitation wavelength of 482\u2009nm and an emission wavelength of 515\u2009nm. The fluorescence signals increased linearly, at least within 300\u2009s. The signals were then converted to the concentration of BODIPY-C12 (Invitrogen, Cat. No.: D3823), which is a product of the EnzChek lipase substrate hydrolysis reaction, and then the slope of the curve from 0 to 200\u2009s was calculated to measure the catalytic activity of HSL.\nMeasurement of the HSL activity using pNPB\nThe pNPB assay was done by following the protocol in a previous study. Specifically, the p-nitrophenyl butyrate (Bide Pharmatech Co., Ltd., CAS: 2635-84-9) was prepared as a 200\u2009mM stock in acetonitrile and diluted to 1.25\u2009mM using a reaction buffer containing 25\u2009mM HEPES pH 7.4 and 150\u2009mM NaCl. 20\u2009\u00b5L of the diluted pNPB was mixed with 5\u2009\u00b5L of HSL (100\u2009nM) in 25\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, and 0.01% GDN in a transparent 384-well plate (Corning, REF 3640) at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The absorbance at 380\u2009nm was immediately monitored in a microplate reader (Spark). The Km and kcat were calculated using the Michaelis-Menten equation with GraphPad Software (GraphPad Inc., USA).\nMeasurement of the HSL activity using native substrate DAG\nNative substrate DAG (1,2 Dioleoyl-rac-glycerol) (Sigma, Cat. No.: D8394) was used to measure the enzymatic activities of HSL and HSL(\u0394489-538) in their unphosphorylated and phosphorylated states. DAG was prepared as a 1\u2009mM stock in DMSO and diluted to 100\u2009\u03bcM using a reaction buffer containing 25\u2009mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1.5% BSA. 15\u2009\u03bcL of the diluted DAG substrate was incubated with 15\u2009\u03bcL of different phosphorylation states\u2019 HSL or HSL(\u0394489\u2013538) (74\u2009nM) at room temperature. The enzymatic reactions were stopped by adding 5\u2009\u03bcL of isopropyl alcohol containing 10% formic acid. Subsequently, 60\u2009\u00b5L of methanol, 210\u2009\u00b5L of MTBE, and 60\u2009\u00b5L of ultrapure water were added, and the mixture was vortexed for 30\u2009s and then centrifuged for 10\u2009min at 20,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g. Then, 150\u2009\u00b5L of the supernatant was transferred to a fresh 1.5\u2009mL microtube, and the organic solvent in the tube was slowly evaporated under nitrogen. The samples were then redissolved in the buffer containing 65% isopropyl alcohol, 30% acetonitrile, and 5% water. 50\u2009\u03bcL of redissolved samples were added to a 384-well plate, and the plate was transferred to the Acoustic Ejection Mass Spectrometry (SCIEX, EchoTM MS) device for MS analysis. The amount of the released free fatty acid in each reaction was calculated according to the standard curve using oleic acid (aladdin, CAS: 112-80-1).\nCryo-EM sample preparation and data acquisition\n4\u2009\u03bcL of the purified HSL protein (1.14\u2009mg/mL in 25\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, and 0.01% GDN) was incubated with HSL-IN-1 (100\u2009\u03bc\u039c) at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009h. The sample was then applied onto a freshly glow-discharged holey carbon grid (Quantifoil, Au 300 mesh, R1.2/1.3), blotted for 4\u2009s, and rapidly plunged into liquid ethane using Vitrobot Mark IV operating at 8\u2009\u00b0C and 100% humidity. Movies were recorded on a Titan Krios at 300\u2009kV equipped with a Gatan K3 Summit direct electron detector and GIF Quantum energy filter (slit width 20\u2009eV, Gatan) in super-resolution mode.\nStructure determination and model building\nAll structure determination procedures were performed in cryoSPARC. A workflow chart is available in Supplementary Fig.\u00a01. In summary, 15,292 micrographs went through patch-based CTF estimation and iterative particle auto-picking, yielding 21,915,892 particles, which were subjected to multiple rounds of 2D classifications, resulting in 429,837 selected particles. Among them, the \u201claid-down\u201d views (the first three classes in the representative 2D images of the workflow chart) were found to dominate. Therefore, to generate a reliable initial model, these particles underwent 2D class rebalancing, resulting in 157,244 particles with evenly distributed views. Subsequently, these particles were subjected to a round of ab-initio reconstruction (number of classes\u2009=\u20092, maximum resolution\u2009=\u20095\u2009\u00c5) with C1 symmetry applied, where 25,625 particles (16.3%) produced an initial map with a monomeric shape and 131,619 particles (83.7%) produced an initial map with a dimeric shape. Next, these particles were applied for non-uniform refinement, generating a monomeric shape map at a resolution of 6.8\u2009\u00c5 and a dimeric shape map at a resolution of 3.7\u2009\u00c5 with C2 symmetry applied. To further enhance the resolution to a level where side chain densities are more discernible, seed-facilitated 3D classifications were applied to the initial auto-picked 21,915,892 particles, using the 3.7\u2009\u00c5 map as the good reference and four bad references generated by refining noise to high frequencies with a reversed protein mask. The seed-facilitated 3D classifications were performed sequentially under four-fold, two-fold, and one-fold binnings, progressively sieving particles from 5,509,131 to 3,110,919, and finally to 384,309. Ultimately, the 384,309 particles were used for non-uniform refinement, resulting in a map with a final resolution of 3.4\u2009\u00c5 with C2 symmetry applied.\nThe HSL homodimer was manually built using Coot. Two copies of the AlphaFold2 prediction of the human HSL monomer were manually fitted into the density map to serve as the starting model. The model was then manually adjusted, using aromatic residues as landmarks due to their clear visibility in the cryo-EM map. Each residue was carefully inspected, with their chemical properties considered during modeling. In total, 1150 amino acid residues were modeled. The model was subsequently refined in Phenix, employing with secondary structure and geometry restraints to prevent overfitting. Statistics related to data collection, 3D reconstruction, and model refinement can be found in Supplementary Table\u00a01. All figures in this article related to HSL structure were generated using PyMOL, Chimera, and ChimeraX.\nPreparation of artificial lipid droplets (ALDs)\nThe artificial lipid droplets (ALDs) were prepared following a protocol described previously with slight modifications. Specifically, the 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC, Avanti, CAS: 4235-95-4) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE, Avanti, CAS: 4004-05-1) were dissolved in chloroform. Then the chloroform was evaporated under a nitrogen gas stream. 2\u2009mg of the dried lipids (100% DOPC, or 75%DOPC\u2009+\u200925%DOPE) were resuspended in the lipid droplet buffer (25\u2009mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl) and then mixed with 5\u2009mg of glyceryl trioleate (Sigma, T7140, CAS: 122-32-7). The mixture was vortexed for 60 cycles of 10\u2009s on and 10\u2009s off. The concentration of ALDs was determined by absorbance at 600\u2009nm.\nFlotation assay\nThe flotation assay was done by following a protocol described previously. Specifically, 15\u2009\u03bcg or 30\u2009\u00b5g of each protein was incubated at room temperature for 1\u2009h with ALDs (OD600\u2009=\u20092) in 210\u2009\u00b5L of an assay buffer containing 25\u2009mM HEPES pH 7.4 and 150\u2009mM NaCl. Then 140\u2009\u00b5L of 75% sucrose in the assay buffer was added to give a final sucrose concentration of 30%. To prepare the sucrose density gradient, firstly, 60\u2009\u00b5L of the assay buffer was added to the bottom of a new 1.5\u2009mL microtube; secondly, 260\u2009\u00b5L of 25% sucrose in the assay buffer was carefully loaded at the bottom of the tube using the pipette; thirdly, 320\u2009\u00b5L of the protein-ALDs mixture in 30% sucrose solution was loaded at the bottom of the tube. The tube was centrifugated at 21,100\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 99\u2009min at 23\u2009\u00b0C. After centrifugation, three fractions (bottom: 280\u2009\u00b5L; middle: 260\u2009\u00b5L; top: 100\u2009\u00b5L) were collected from the bottom to top. The same volume of each fraction was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining. The intensities of the protein bands on the SDS-PAGE gels were quantified by ImageJ. The binding ratio of each protein with ALDs was calculated using the following equation:\nin which DT, DM, and DB represent the intensities of HSL from the top (100\u2009\u00b5L), middle (260\u2009\u00b5L), and bottom (280\u2009\u00b5L) fractions on the SDS-PAGE gels, respectively.\nGeneration of stably transduced Huh-7 cells\nTo generate the lentivirus, 10\u2009mL of the HEK293T cells (3\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells/mL) were plated in a 10-cm dish. Once the cells were grown to 60% confluency, they were transfected with 9\u2009\u00b5g of pCDH (Addgene plasmid # 72265), 5\u2009\u00b5g of pMDL, 3\u2009\u00b5g of VSVG and 2\u2009\u00b5g of REV plasmids using 38\u2009\u00b5g of linear polyethylenimine 25,000 (Polysciences, Cat. No.: 23966). The medium was exchanged 8\u2009h after transfection. The cells were cultured for 48\u2009h after transfection, then the supernatant was harvested and filtered through a 0.22\u2009\u00b5m syringe filter. The filtrate containing the virus was used immediately or stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C.\nTo generate Huh-7 cells stably expressing EGFP or EGFP fusion proteins, Huh-7 cells seeded on 6-well plates (Corning, Cat. No.: 3516) at 40\u201360% confluency were infected with a mixture of 1\u2009mL/well of DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 16\u2009\u00b5g of polybrene (Merck, Cat. No.: TR-1003-G) and 1\u2009mL/well of the virus. After 24\u2009h, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM medium supplemented with\u00a010% (v/v) fetal bovine serum\u00a0(FBS) (Cellmax, SA211.02) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin\u00a0(P/S) (Cytiva, SV30010). 48\u2009h after infection, the medium was replaced with DMEM medium supplemented with\u200910% FBS, 1% P/S, and 2\u2009\u00b5g/mL puromycin (invivogen, Cat. No.: ant-pr). The cells were maintained under puromycin selection for 7\u2009days to get the stably transfected Huh-7 cells, passaging as required.\nCell imaging assay\n3T3-L1 preadipocytes (ATCC Number: CL_173), HEK293T (ATCC, Cat. No.: CRL-3216), and Huh-7 (Cat. No.: TCHu182) were cultured in the Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Gibco, C11995500BT) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS\u00a0 and 1% P/S at 37\u2009\u00b0C with 5% CO2. Then the cells were seeded to six-well glass bottom plates (NEST, 801004). After 24\u2009h, the confluency reached around 80%. Then the cells were transfected with the plasmids of human HSL and its variants in pcDNA3.1 vector using Lipo3000 (Invitrogen, L3000008). 11\u2009h after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS\u00a0, 1% P/S\u00a0, and 200\u2009\u00b5M of oleic acid (aladdin, CAS: 112-80-1) conjugated to fatty acid-free BSA (GOLDBIO, CAS: 9048-46-8) (oleic acid:BSA\u2009=\u20096:1, molar ratio). The cells were cultured for additional 15\u2009h to enable the formation of lipid droplets. Then the cells were fixed by treating the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde (Beyotime, P0099) for 30\u2009min at room temperature. After fixation, the fixed cells were gently washed with PBS buffer for 3 times to remove residual formaldehyde. Then the neutral lipids in the fixed cells were stained with LipidTOX Deep Red (Invitrogen, HCS LipidTOX\u2122, H34477) at room temperature for at least 30\u2009min before imaging. The cells were imaged with 63\u00d7 oil objectives on a ZEISS LSM 980 in the Airyscan super-resolution mode. The images were processed using the ZEISS ZEN lite software.\nFor stably transfected Huh-7 cells, the cells at 60% confluency were treated with oleic acid (200\u2009\u03bcM) for 15\u2009h to facilitate the formation of lipid droplets. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and imaged following the protocol detailed above.\nTo study the effect of PKA activation on HSL localization and phosphorylation, after treating the cells for 15\u2009h with oleic acid conjugated to fatty acid-free BSA, the cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 2% fatty acid-free BSA for 1\u2009h. Then the culture medium was replaced by fresh DMEM medium supplemented with 2% fatty acid-free BSA, 1\u2009mM IBMX, and 10\u2009\u00b5M forskolin (or the same volume of DMSO), and the cells were cultured for 2\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and imaged following the protocol detailed above.\nInduced differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes\nTo generate 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stably expressing EGFP fusion proteins, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes seeded on 6-well plates (Corning, Cat. No.: 3516) at 40\u201360% confluency were infected with a mixture of 1\u2009mL/well of DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 16\u2009\u00b5g of polybrene (Merck, Cat. No.: TR-1003-G) and 1\u2009mL/well of the lentivirus as mentioned before. After 24\u2009h, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM medium supplemented with\u200910% FBS and 1% P/S. After 48\u2009h of infection, the medium was replaced with DMEM medium supplemented with\u200910% FBS, 1% P/S. Three rounds of lentivirus infections were carried out with HSL-EGFP fusion constructs, passaging as required. The cells were maintained under puromycin selection for 2\u2009rounds to get the stably transfected 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.\nThe differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocyte was followed by Abcam\u2019s protocol originally adapted from a prior report. Briefly, the stably transfected 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were seeded on six-well plates and in DMEM medium until 70% confluency. 2 days later, the medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with\u200910% FBS, 1% P/S, 1\u2009\u03bcM dexamethasone (Beyotime, Cat. No.: ST1258), 0.5\u2009mM IBMX (Beyotime, Cat. No.: ST1398), and 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL insulin (Beyotime, Cat. No.: P3376). After 2 days, cells were maintained in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, 1% P/S, 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL insulin for 2 days, then in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, 1% P/S, without insulin for an additional 3\u20134 days before use. To study the effect of PKA activation on HSL localization and phosphorylation, the cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 2% fatty acid-free BSA, 1\u2009mM IBMX, and 10\u2009\u00b5M forskolin (or the same volume of DMSO), and the cells were cultured for 2\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The cells were then measured for the phosphorylation level by Western blot or fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and imaged with 63\u00d7 oil objectives on a ZEISS LSM 980 confocal microscope.\nReverse transcription and qPCR analysis\nThe total RNA of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes treated with OA, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 1\u2009\u03bcg of the total RNA was reversely transcribed into cDNA using HiScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Vazyme). The cDNA was then used as the template for qPCR analysis using Hieff qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (YEASEN) on the CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The mRNA expression levels were normalized to \u03b2-actin. The qPCR primers used in this study are listed as follows:\n PLIN1: \nForward sequence (5\u2019\u20133\u2019): GGGACCTGTGAGTGCTTCC\nReverse sequence (5\u2019\u20133\u2019): GTATTGAAGAGCCGGGATCTTTT\n \u03b2-actin: \nForward sequence (5\u2019\u20133\u2019): GGCTGTATTCCCCTCCATCG\nReverse sequence (5\u2019\u20133\u2019): CCAGTTGGTAACAATGCCATGT\nImage quantification and statistics\nThe LD-targeted signal was calculated and analyzed following a protocol described previously. Specifically, ImageJ software was used to analyze all the images. To determine the LD area in the cell, Otsu thresholding was applied to the LipidTOX channel, and the resulting area was measured. The image was background-corrected, and the mean EGFP signal in that region was quantified. Then, the size and the mean EGFP signal of the whole cell were measured. To quantify the %LD-targeted signal for different HSL-EGFP constructs, the total EGFP signal on LDs was calculated as a ratio to the total EGFP signal in the entire cell. The results represented the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experiments (n\u2009=\u200915, a total of 15 cells were analyzed from three independent measurements) and were analyzed using the unpaired t-test in Prism to calculate the two-tailed P-values.\nDetection of the phosphorylation level of HSL that was transiently expressed in cells\nAfter the cells were treated with 1\u2009mM IBMX, and 10\u2009\u00b5M forskolin (or the same volume of DMSO), they were collected and washed once with 1\u00d7 PBS and then lysed with 100\u2009\u00b5L of RIPA buffer (Beyotime #P0013B) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (VWR International). The concentration of each sample was determined by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No.: 23225 and Cat. No.: 23227). Equal amounts of each sample were mixed with 5\u00d7 SDS Loading buffer and boiled at 98\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a 0.22\u2009\u00b5m polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. After blocking with 5% milk, the membrane was probed with the primary antibodies, including anti-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804), anti-GFP (Proteintech, HRP-66002), anti-PLIN1-pS522 (Vala Sciences, 4856), anti-HSL-pS660 (CST, 45804S), anti-HSL-pS565 (CST, 4137T), anti-GAPDH (immunoWay, YM3029), anti-\u03b2-actin (immunoWay, YM3028), and the secondary antibodies including goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (Sigma #AP156P) and goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (Sigma #AP157P) at a dilution ratio of 1:10,000 in TBST buffer. The chemiluminescence signal of the horseradish peroxidase was detected using Amersham Imager 680 (Cytiva).\nPhosphorylation and dephosphorylation of purified HSL and PLIN1\nPurified HSL (final concentration: 17.5\u2009\u03bcM) was phosphorylated by PKA (final concentration: 5.7\u2009\u03bcM) in 1\u2009mL of a phosphorylation buffer (25\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 0.01% GDN, 10\u2009mM DTT, 50\u2009mM MgCl2, 10\u2009mM ATP) for 2\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Then HSL in the sample was purified by gel filtration (Superdex 200 increase, 10/30, GE Healthcare) with a running buffer containing 25\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, and 0.01% GDN. The peak fractions were collected and used for biochemical assays. Purified HSL was dephosphorylated by incubating HSL (final concentration: 17.5\u2009\u03bcM) with PP1\u03b1 (final concentration: 2.5\u2009\u03bcM) in 1\u2009mL of a dephosphorylation buffer (25\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 0.01% GDN, 5\u2009mM MnCl2) for 2\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Then HSL in the sample was purified by gel filtration (Superdex 200 increase, 10/30, GE Healthcare). After phosphorylation or dephosphorylation, the HSL samples were analyzed by Western Blot. After phosphorylation or dephosphorylation, the HSL samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry and Western blot. The phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of purified PLIN1 was performed using the same protocol as HSL.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.",

        "TITLE": "The Ceramide-Dependent EV Secretome Differentially Affects Prostate Cancer Cell Migration",
        "ABSTRACT": "Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) play an important role in cancer progression. Neutral sphingomyelinases (nSMases) are lipid-modifying enzymes that modulate the secretion of EVs from cells. How nSMase activity and therefore ceramide generation affect the composition and functionality of secreted EVs is not fully understood. Here, we aimed to investigate the expression of nSMases 1 and 2 in prostate cancer (PCa) tissue and their role in EV composition and secretion for prostate cancer cell migration. Reduced nSMase 1 and 2 expression was found in prostate cancer and correlated with the age of the patient. When nSMase 2 was inhibited by GW4869 in PCa cells (PC3 and DU145), the EV secretome was significantly altered, while the number of EVs and the total protein content of released EVs were not significantly changed. Using proteomic analysis, we found that extracellular matrix proteins, such as SDC4 (Syndecan-4) and SRPX-2, were differentially secreted on EVs from GW4869-treated PC3 cells. In scratch wound migration assays, GW4869 significantly increased migration compared to control PC3 cells but not DU145 cells, while SDC4 knockdown significantly reduced the migration of PC3 cells. These and other nSMase-2-dependent secreted proteins are interesting candidates for understanding the role of stress-induced EVs in the progression of prostate cancer.",
        "INTRO": "1. Introduction\nProstate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men. This heterogeneous disease is characterized by high variability in clinical outcomes. PCa progresses slowly and can be treated effectively when detected early. But, identifying patients likely to progress remains difficult, resulting in cases being diagnosed after the cancer has already advanced to metastasis. A better understanding of the progression of tumors and the development of approaches for earlier detection is therefore needed.\nRecently, a number of studies have shown that extracellular vesicles (EVs) play important roles in PCa progression by stimulating malignant transformation, crosstalk with neighboring cells and macrophages, and osteoblast differentiation during metastasis. Currently, the decision regarding non-metastasized prostate cancer treatment (curative treatments or active surveillance) is almost exclusively based on histological architecture (Gleason score), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and the local disease state (TNM (tumor, nodes, metastasis)). However, early detection and routine surveillance could benefit tremendously from novel biomarkers and a better understanding of the biology of prostate cancer.\nIn addition to PSA, emerging biomarkers such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), cell-free DNA (cfDNA), and non-coding RNAs (e.g., PCA3, miR-141, and miR-375) are gaining attention for their potential in prostate cancer detection and prognosis. Moreover, extracellular-vesicle-associated markers such as CD9, CD63, and TSG101 have been identified as promising diagnostic tools, offering a more precise molecular signature of tumor-derived EVs. These advancements could significantly improve patient stratification and treatment decisions.\nNeutral sphingomyelinases (nSMases; gene names: sphingomyelin (SM) phosphodiesterases, SMPDs) hydrolyze SM to phosphocholine and ceramides (Cer). Cer function as lipid second messengers in cellular signaling pathways in tumor-suppressive and anti-proliferative processes. Ceramide synthesis by nSMase 2 is also involved in the secretion of small EVs, and thus, GW4869, an nSMase 2 inhibitor, is widely used in cell culture to inhibit exosome secretion. However, the effects are cell-line-dependent, as, in breast cancer cells, GW4869 leads to an increase in larger EVs from the plasma membrane and a decrease in smaller EVs. This study aims to investigate the role of nSMase2 in prostate cancer progression by analyzing its impact on EV secretion and composition. Through proteomic profiling and functional assays, we explored how nSMase2 inhibition alters the EV cargo composition and where these changes contribute to tumor cell migration. We elucidated the functional implication of the ceramide-dependent EV secretome in cancer progression. In the malignant prostate cancer cell line PC3, we found that GW4869 alters the protein content of the released EVs and supports tumor cell migration via the secretion of ECM proteins.",
        "RESULTS": "3. Results\n3.1. Reduced SMPD2 and SMPD3 Expression in Prostate Cancer\nTo investigate the role of nSMase 1 and nSMase 2 (gene names: SMPD2 and SMPD3) in prostate cancer progression, we evaluated their protein levels via immunohistochemical staining of prostate cancer tissues and prostate tissue arrays (n = 104) (Figure 1A,B), with the androgen receptor (AR) for positive control staining (Figure S1). Antibody staining was evaluated semi-automatically using quPath, and the intensity correlated with age, TNM parameters, histopathological grading, UICC stage, and Gleason score based on the H-score values (0\u2013300). In men over 70 years, we found significantly lower SMPD2, SMPD3, and AR levels than in men under 70 (Figure 1C\u2013F), consistent with declining AR expression in prostate tissue with age.\nIn addition, we analyzed the expression of SMPD2 and SMPD3 in prostate and prostate cancer samples from the proteinatlas database. Similarly to the immunohistochemical staining of SMPD2 and SMPD3, lower expression of SMPD2 or SMPD3 was observed in prostate cancer versus healthy tissue (Figure 2A,B).\nTo establish a pipeline for biomarker identification for prostate cancer, we previously compared EVs secreted from malignant PC3 and DU145 cells, from bone and brain metastases, respectively, to EVs from benign prostate PTNA1 cells in a proteomics screen. When comparing SMPD2 and SMPD3 levels in seven prostate cancer cell lines from proteinatlas data, DU145 and PC3 were in the middle-to-low range of expression, and SMPD2 levels were higher than SMPD3 levels (Figure 2C). By Western blot analysis, we confirmed that the protein levels of SMPD2 and SMPD3 in DU145 and PC3 cell lysates were detectable (Figure 2D,E).\nWe next tested the functional effect of nSMase 2 on cancer cell migration by using GW4869, an inhibitor of nSMase 2 activity. Cell viability under 5 \u00b5M GW4869 was unchanged in DMSO-treated control cells after 24 h (Figure S2A,B). In a scratch wound assay (Figure 2F\u2013I), the migration speed differed between the two cell lines. PC3 cells reached 40% wound closure after 24 h, whereas DU145 wounds were closed after 24 to 36 h. Interestingly, in the presence of GW4869, wound closure after 12 to 24 h was significantly faster in PC3 cells than in DMSO-treated control cells (Figure 2F,G). In contrast, DU145 cells\u2019 wound closure was independent of GW4869 treatment (Figure 2H,I). Taken together, we found lower levels of nSMases in cancer tissue and samples from older patients and found that the reduced activity of nSMase 2 contributed to the malignant behavior of PC3 cells but not DU145 cells.\n3.2. Ceramide-Dependent EV Secretion from PC3 Cells\nExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are small membrane particles of 50\u2013450 nm, secreted from different cell types. Recently, a number of studies have shown that EVs from malignant cells and their protein composition stimulate cell migration and invasion. Thus, we next focused on the role of nSMase 2 activity in EV secretion from prostate cancer cells. From the supernatants of PC3 and DU145 cells treated with GW4869 or DMSO in exo-free DMEM for 24 h, we purified EVs by differential centrifugation with 14,000\u00d7 g and 100,000\u00d7 g steps to purify large and small EVs. Nanoparticle tracking analysis revealed overlapping size profiles of large/P14-EVs (130\u2013350 nm) and small/P100-EVs (50\u2013210 nm) for both cell lines (Figure 3A\u2013E, Figure S2C\u2013G).\nInhibition of nSMase 2 activity supposedly blocks EV secretion, but recently, we found that GW4869 differentially affects the amount of EVs secreted. For PC3 cells, the concentration of larger P14-EVs was unchanged by GW4869 treatment, while P100-EVs were slightly increased in the size range of 110\u2013150 nm (Figure 3C,E). The secretion of P14 and P100-EVs from DU145 was not changed by GW4869 (Figure S2C\u2013G). Western blot analysis of the cell lysate and P100 showed that Calnexin did not contaminate the P100 fractions in either cell line. Alix, CD63, and Syntenin, all markers for small EVs, were enriched in EVs from GW4869-treated cells, while CD81 was reduced in P100 (Figure 3F\u2013H). Thus, rather than blocking EV secretion, inhibition of nSMase 2 activity might alter the protein composition of secreted EVs from PCa cells.\n3.3. Ceramide-Dependent EV Proteome\nNext, we subjected EV preparations from DMSO- and GW4869-treated PC3 and DU145 cells to label-free mass spectrometry-based proteomics, with subsequent quality control and candidate selection (Figure 4A). We first investigated the overall composition of EVs secreted from both prostate cell lines in the two purified EV fractions, P14 and P100. A full list of all identified proteins is given in Supplemental Table S1. Upon the analysis of all 1495 proteins quantified, with a false discovery rate of 1% for both EV fractions and both replicates from DMSO-treated cells, we identified 172 proteins on P14-EVs and 217 on P100-EVs from PC3, of which 137 overlapped. From the 137 overlapping proteins in PC3-EVs, 60 were known TOP EV proteins (Figure 4B). From DU145 cells, 252 proteins were identified in P14-EVs and 221 in P100-EVs, of which 178 overlapped, with 47 being TOP EV proteins ( (accessed on 26 January 2021)) (Figure 4C). This analysis is a proof of principle for our EV isolation technique and shows that, in both P14 and P100 fractions, the abundant proteins from Mass Spec overlap with the Top EV markers. In addition, our method is in line with EV isolation guidelines.\nOur next aim was to see which EV markers were enriched in the GW4869 treatment compared to DMSO. This involved calculating differentially regulated markers that were 1.5-fold enriched upon GW4869 treatment. From PC3 cells, a total of 49 proteins were enriched in P14 and 93 proteins in the P100 fraction with GW4869, of which 33 overlapped (Figure 4D).\nFrom DU145 cells, 171 proteins were enriched in the P14 fraction and 36 enriched in the P100 fraction with GW4869, with 26 proteins overlapping (Figure 4E). Interestingly, of these 33 and 26 overlapping proteins between P14 and P100 EVs from each PC3 and DU145 cell line upon GW4869 treatment, 13 were found to be upregulated in both EV fractions from both cell lines. As both P14 EV and P100 EV could contribute to tumor cell migration, the overlap between them was taken for a further analysis of factors. String database annotation showed a strong connection between the identified proteins (Figure 4G,H). Gene ontology (GO) term and Reactome database analyses revealed a >20-fold enrichment of cellular components, such as extracellular matrix components, collagens, and laminins, and glycan degradation in the GW4869-P100 and P14 fractions in both cell lines (Figure 5A\u2013D). Thus, upon nSMase 2 inhibition, ECM components were secreted in EVs from both PCa cell lines.\n3.4. Ceramide-Dependent Tumor Migration\nThe dependence on the purification technique and the biological similarity of P14- and P100-EVs has led to current EV research treating these not as individual populations but as a heterogeneous mixture of EVs. Indeed, from the significantly quantified proteins in both cell lines and both fractions, we found 20 proteins enriched in PC3 EV fractions, 13 proteins in both fractions in both cell lines, and 13 exclusively upregulated in DU145 EV fractions (Figure 6A). Among the components differentially affected by nSMase 2 inhibition were several laminins, glypican, and other matrix proteins (Table S2). Finally, we selected two interesting proteins enriched in PC3 EVs in a ceramide-dependent manner, SDC4 and SRPX2, as candidates to further characterize in the wound-healing assay. SRPX2, a ligand for the urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor, is commonly overexpressed in several types of cancer, including prostate cancer. Interestingly, SRPX2 promotes cell migration and adhesion through focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation. Similarly, SDC4 is a proteoglycan involved in the generation of sEVs from endosomal compartments, and its high expression is involved in cancer cell invasion. To elucidate whether the two candidates contributed to cell migration by being sorted into EVs in an nSMase-2-dependent manner, we created phenocopies by siRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) in both prostate cancer cells. SDC4 and SRPX2 siRNAs were transiently transfected into DU145 and PC3 cells, and knockdown efficiency was more than 50%, as shown by quantitative PCR (Figure 6B,C,F,G). While SRPX2 KD had no effect on PCa cell migration, SDC4 KD led to significantly slower wound closure in both cell lines, with a stronger effect in PC3 cells (Figure 6D,E,H,I). Taken together, our results suggest an nSMase-2-dependent role for EV-sorted matrix components that might be functionally relevant in prostate cancer cell migration.",
        "DISCUSS": "4. Discussion\nOur study provides new insights into the role of neutral sphingomyelinases (nSMases) (SMPD2 and SMPD3) in prostate cancer progression and extracellular vesicle (EV) secretion. We found that the reduced expression of nSMases in prostate cancer correlates with age. NSMase2 inhibition alters the composition of EVs secreted from prostate cancer cells. In particular, extracellular matrix proteins, including Syndecan-4 (SDC4) and SRPX-2, are differentially secreted in EVs, as our proteomic analysis revealed. NSMase2 inhibition enhanced the migration of PC3 but not DU145 cells, which was reduced in the SDC4 KD experiment. The results demonstrate that SMPD2 and SMPD3 expression is reduced in prostate cancer, indicating that a potential disruption in sphingomyelin metabolism and EV secretion may contribute to tumor progression.\n4.1. nSMase Suppression and Prostate Cancer Progression\nOur first significant finding was the reduced expression of SMPD2 and SMPD3 in prostate cancer tissues and samples from older patients. This downregulation suggests a possible tumor-suppressive role of these enzymes, aligning with previous studies that have implicated sphingolipid metabolism in stress pathways and apoptosis induction. Specifically, nSMase 2 is considered a major candidate for mediating the stress-induced production of ceramide, leading to apoptosis. The inhibition of nSMase 2 activity using GW4869 in PC3 and DU145 cells resulted in an altered EV composition; similarly, we previously reported that GW4869 changes EV secretion from breast cancer cells, resulting in the changed metabolic and proteomic profiles of these EVs. This is further supported by the hypothesis that nSMases play a critical role in modulating EV cargo release, as shown by recent proteomic studies. In a recent meta-study of lipid profiling of patient samples of different tumor entities, it was demonstrated that low values in tissue samples and high values in liquid samples indicated a poor prognostic trend, a fact that is in agreement with cancer cells secreting EVs, which contain a characteristic set of proteins and lipids. Our results are in line with the idea that altered EV secretion from cancer cells influences the tumor microenvironment, shifting it toward tumor progression, and hold promise for a better understanding of cancer biology as well as disease monitoring.\n4.2. EV Secretion and Cell Migration\nUpon nSMase2 inhibition, altered EV secretion coincided with an increase in the migration of PC3 cells, a hallmark of cancer metastasis. This finding is particularly notable, as EVs are known to carry signaling molecules that can modulate the behavior of recipient cells, including metabolism and invasion. The enhanced migration seen in our study suggests that nSMase 2 inhibition may enhance the pro-tumorigenic potential of prostate cancer cells by altering the composition of secreted EVs. Signaling molecules on EVs that mediate migration are cell adhesion molecules and ECM proteins (such as integrins and fibronectin), which promote cell persistence and efficient directional movement. The specific mechanisms by which the here-identified proteins regulate cell migration, however, warrant further investigation.\n4.3. NSMase-Dependent EV Proteome: Cell Type Specificity\nOur proteomic analysis of EVs revealed an nSMase-2-dependent, cell-type-specific EV proteome. This finding is important, as it suggests that the role of SMPD2 and SMPD3 in EV biogenesis and protein cargo loading may vary between different prostate cancer cell lines. Proteins enriched in EVs, including those involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and cell adhesion (e.g., laminins and glypicans), could be key drivers of tumor cell behavior, facilitating processes such as cell migration and invasion. In a previous study, we compared EVs secreted from malignant PC3 cells and benign PNT1A cells and found 64 proteins exclusively in PC3-derived sEVs, including claudin 3, which enabled the discrimination of plasma from prostate cancer patients from healthy donors. The enrichment of these ECM proteins within EVs supports the idea that nSMase 2 activity is modulated upon tumor progression and may regulate the tumor microenvironment through EV-mediated ECM remodeling. Identifying factors that are detectable in the plasma and discriminate between early and late or local and metastasizing tumors may help to assess and guide decisions for prostate cancer treatment.\n4.4. Functional Roles of SDC4 and SRPX2\nTwo proteins identified in the EV proteome, SDC4 and SRPX2, were further characterized due to their potential relevance to cancer progression, as seen in other cancer entities, such as thyroid, pancreas, and gastric cancer. The knockdown of SDC4 in PC3 cells significantly reduced cell migration, as demonstrated by wound-healing assays. This suggests that SDC4 plays a critical role in regulating cell motility, potentially through its involvement in ECM interactions and cell adhesion processes. SRPX2 has been previously implicated in prostate cancer, and its presence in EVs may suggest a role in promoting metastasis. Syndecan and syntenin expression at various stages of prostate cancer varies according to the genetic heterogeneity of the tumors. These and other nSMase-2-dependent secreted proteins are interesting candidates for understanding the role of stress-induced EVs in the progression of prostate cancer and might have biomarker potential if they are secreted at an early stage of cancer progression. Further studies are needed to elucidate the exact function of EV-secreted proteins in prostate cancer.\n4.5. Conclusions\nOur findings highlight the importance of nSMase 2 in modulating EV secretion and proteome composition in prostate cancer. Similar to the cell-type-specific regulation of lipid metabolism, the cell-type-specific EV proteome suggests that different prostate cancer cell types may rely on distinct EV-mediated mechanisms for progression and metastasis. This opens up the possibility of targeting nSMase 2 pathways or EV-associated proteins like SDC4 as potential therapeutic strategies for limiting prostate cancer metastasis. A recent study showed that using cell-line-derived EV-based proteins for PCa diagnostics can help to identify markers that discriminate metastasizing from local PCa.\nFuture research should focus on the mechanistic details of how nSMase 2 regulates EV cargo selection and secretion and how these EVs influence the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, the targeting of SDC4 and SRPX2 in prostate cancer should be explored further, particularly in relation to their roles in cell migration and metastasis. While our findings provide novel insights into nSMase2-dependent EV secretion and its role in prostate cancer migration, this study was limited to in vitro models. Further studies should validate these findings in vivo to confirm the physiological relevance of our observations. Additionally, the impact of nSMase2 inhibition on EV secretion and tumor progression in a complex tumor microenvironment remains to be explored.\nDisclaimer/Publisher\u2019s Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

        "METHODS": "2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Cell Culture and Transfection\nDU145 (ACC 261) and PC3 cells (ACC 465) (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) were cultured under standard conditions. DU145 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco), while PC3 cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco), both supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). Cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected with Screenfect siRNA (Screenfect GmbH, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and cells were routinely checked for mycoplasma contamination to ensure cultural integrity. Dharmacon siRNA SMARTpools (Lafayette, CO, USA) were used against the sequences in the Table 1 below.\n2.2. Real-Time qPCR\nTotal RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol reagent (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). A total of 5 \u00b5g of RNA was used for complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis with the REVERT AID FIRST STRAND cDNA Synthesis Kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). The synthesized cDNA was then subjected to quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using iQ SYBR Green SUPERMIX (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and specific primers targeting \u03b2-actin (Fwd: GAGCACAGAGCCTCGCCTTT, Rev: ACATGCCGGAGCCGTTGTC), SDC4 (Fwd: GGCCTTCCTCCCTTCCTTTC, Rev: CATCTCAAGGTGCAGGTGGT), and SRPX-2 (Fwd: TGGCAAAAGCGGACTATGGG, Rev: ATGGGGCCTGGTCATCTGTA). Gene expression levels were determined using the 2\u2212\u2206\u2206Ct method, with \u03b2-actin serving as the reference gene for normalization. qRT-PCR was performed on a CFX system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).\n2.3. Extracellular Vesicle Purification\nExtracellular vesicles were purified by differential centrifugation as described previously. In short, conditioned-medium supernatants from mammalian cells were subjected to sequential centrifugation steps of 750\u00d7 g, 1500\u00d7 g, and 14,000\u00d7 g before pelleting exosomes at 100,000\u00d7 g in a SW41Ti swinging-bucket rotor for 2 h (Beckman, Brea, CA, USA). After discarding the supernatant, the resulting exosome pellet was dissolved in fresh PBS.\n2.4. Immunohistochemistry\nParaffin-embedded tissue arrays (PR808, PR242b) with a total of 104 cores from 45 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma and 7 healthy prostate tissues in duplicate with TNM, stage, Gleason score, and grade information were obtained from Biocat, Heidelberg, Germany. Arrays were heated at 50 \u00b0C to facilitate paraffin removal. Deparaffinization was carried out using a graded alcohol series, beginning with 100% xylol for 20 min, followed by 70% ethanol for 5 min. After three washes with water (5 min each), antigen retrieval was performed by heating the slides in citric acid buffer (pH 6.4) using a microwave-compatible pressure cooker. The slides were then allowed to cool, rinsed with water, and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 3% H2O2 for 45 min to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity. Following PBS washes, the slides were blocked with bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h before being incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with primary antibodies\u2014SMPD2 (rabbit, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), SMPD3 (rabbit and mouse, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA), and androgen receptor (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) as a positive control. A no-primary-antibody control was also included. Antibodies were diluted 1:50 in BSA. The next day, slides were washed with PBS-T and incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:200, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. After another PBS-T wash, they were treated with avidin-linked peroxidase (1:1000, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 45 min. Immunostaining was performed using 2% 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) with 0.12\u2030 H2O2 in PBS, and the reaction was stopped after 3.5 min. Finally, slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated through an alcohol series (50% xylol/isopropanol, 100% isopropanol, followed by 100%, 90%, and 70% ethanol), mounted, and left to dry overnight under a fume hood.\n2.5. TMA Evaluation\nTissue microarray (TMA) slides were digitized using the Motic EasyScan One whole-slide scanner (Motic, Xiamen, China) at 20\u00d7 magnification, achieving a resolution of 0.5 \u03bcm/pixel. Semi-automated immunohistochemical analysis was performed using QuPath software (v0.2.0-m8). Tissue cores were identified through an automated TMA dearrayer, with manual verification and adjustments as necessary. Stain separation was optimized using color deconvolution, incorporating spot vector and background estimates for accuracy. Automated cell and membrane detection was employed to identify cells within TMA cores, where cell boundaries were estimated based on constrained nuclear expansion. A total of 33 intensity and morphological parameters were measured, including nuclear area, circularity, staining intensities for hematoxylin and DAB, and the nucleus-to-cell area ratio. From these, 16 key features were empirically selected for further analysis, complemented by local cell density metrics using Gaussian-weighted smoothing. To differentiate tumor cells from other cell types (e.g., stromal cells), a two-way random tree classifier was trained. Tumor cells were further classified into negative, weakly positive, moderately positive, or strongly positive based on the mean DAB optical density. H-scores (ranging from 0 to 300) were calculated as follows: (3\u00d7 % strongly stained) + (2\u00d7 % moderately stained) + (1\u00d7 % weakly stained). Biomarker expression (H-score values) was analyzed in relation to clinical characteristics, including age, TNM stage, histopathological grading, UICC stage, and Gleason score, using Mann\u2013Whitney tests. Age groups were classified as <70 or \u226570 years. T2, T3, and T4 tumor stages were consolidated into two categories, and UICC stages II and III\u2013IV were combined. Lymph node involvement (N) and distant metastasis (M) were categorized as either positive or negative. Gleason scores were dichotomized as \u22646 or >6. Statistical analyses were conducted using Prism software (version 10.4.1, GraphPad, Boston, MA, USA), with a significance level of \u03b1 = 5%.\n2.6. Immunoblot\nTo analyze total cell lysates via immunoblotting, cells were first lysed to extract proteins. The lysates were then mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min to denature proteins and ensure uniform charge distribution. Proteins were separated on 4\u201312% gradient gels (Bolt Bis-Tris Plus Gels, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and subsequently transferred onto PVDF membranes (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Following blocking with 5% (wt/vol) milk in TBST, membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies. The next day, they were washed with TBST and incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies conjugated to LICOR 680 nm or 800 nm fluorophores. After final washes in TBST, signal detection was performed using a LICOR imaging system (Lincoln, NE, USA).\n2.7. Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis\nExtracellular vesicle (EV) samples were diluted 1:25 in PBS by mixing 16 \u03bcL of the sample with 384 \u03bcL of PBS. The diluted solution was then injected into the measurement chamber of the NanoSight LM10 system (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). Video recordings of 60 s were captured using the NanoSight NTA 2.3 Analytical Software and an sCMOS camera (Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, UK), with the following settings: shutter speed 30.01 ms, gain 500, frame rate 24.99 fps, and temperature 22.5 \u00b0C. For each sample, three separate videos were recorded, ensuring at least 200 detectable particle tracks per video. The measurement position was slightly adjusted between recordings to account for sample heterogeneity. The recorded videos were analyzed using NanoSight NTA 2.3 Analytical Software, providing data on particle concentration, size distribution, mean size, and mode size of the EV samples.\n2.8. Viability Assay\nCell viability after GW4869 treatment was measured by performing CellTiter-Glo assays (Promega, Madison, WI, USA): Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate. After treatment with GW4869 or DMSO for 16 h, 100 \u03bcL of the cell titer glow reagent was added to each well (1:1). The plate was incubated on a shaker for 2 min at RT to allow cell lysis and then incubated without shaking for 10 min to allow luminescence signal stabilization. The signal was measured using a luminometer, and data were analyzed using MikroWin 2000 lite version 4.43.\n2.9. Proliferation and Migration Assay\nPC3 and DU145 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at varying densities, ranging from 5 k to 10 k, 20 k, 40 k, and 50 k cells/well, and then incubated for 24 h at 37.5 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 to allow cell attachment. A wound of defined width was created using the WoundMaker tool (IncuCyte, Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany), and cells were subsequently washed with fresh medium (DMEM for PC3, RPMI1640 for DU145) to remove cell debris. Cells were then treated with DMSO (vehicle control) or 10 \u00b5M GW4869 or untreated medium. Plates were then placed in the IncuCyte S3 live cell imaging system at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2, and images of every well were taken every hour for 24 h to track wound closure. The rate of migration was analyzed by measuring the reduction in wound area over time using IncuCyte software (v2018B).\n2.10. Mass Spectrometry\nSamples were reconstituted in 1\u00d7 NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and applied to 4\u201312% NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris Minigels (Invitrogen). Samples were run 1 cm into the gel for purification and stained with Coomassie Blue for visualization purposes. After washing, gel slices were reduced with dithiothreitol (DTT), alkylated with 2-iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin overnight. The resulting peptide mixtures were then extracted, dried in a SpeedVac (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) reconstituted in 2% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid (v:v), and prepared for nanoLC-MS/MS as described previously. All samples were spiked with a synthetic peptide standard used for retention time alignment (iRT Standard, Schlieren, Switzerland). Protein digests were analyzed on a nanoflow chromatography system (Eksigent nanoLC425, Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA) hyphenated to a hybrid triple-quadrupole\u2013TOF mass spectrometer (TripleTOF 5600+, Sciex) equipped with a Nanospray III ion source (Ionspray Voltage 2400 V, Interface Heater Temperature 150 \u00b0C, Sheath Gas Setting 12) and controlled by Analyst TF 1.7.1 software build 1163 (all Sciex). In brief, peptides were dissolved in loading buffer (2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in water) to a concentration of 0.3 \u00b5g/\u00b5L. For each analysis, 1.5 \u00b5g of digested protein was enriched on a precolumn (0.18 mm ID \u00d7 20 mm, Symmetry C18, 5 \u00b5m, Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and separated on an analytical RP-C18 column (0.075 mm ID \u00d7 250 mm, HSS T3, 1.8 \u00b5m, Waters) using a 90 min linear gradient of 5\u201335% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid (v:v) at 300 nL min\u22121.\nQualitative LC/MS/MS analysis was performed using a Top25 data-dependent acquisition method with an MS survey scan of m/z 350\u20131250 accumulated for 350 ms at a resolution of 30,000 full width at half maximum (FWHM). MS/MS scans of m/z 180\u20131600 were accumulated for 100 ms at a resolution of 17,500 FWHM and a precursor isolation width of 0.7 FWHM, resulting in a total cycle time of 2.9 s. Precursors above a threshold MS intensity of 125 cps with charge states 2+, 3+, and 4+ were selected for MS/MS, and the dynamic exclusion time was set to 30 s. MS/MS activation was achieved by CID using nitrogen as a collision gas and the manufacturer\u2019s default rolling collision energy settings. Two technical replicates per sample were analyzed to construct a spectral library.\nFor quantitative SWATH analysis, MS/MS data were acquired using 65 variable-size windows across the 400\u20131050 m/z range. Fragments were produced using rolling collision energy settings for charge state 2+, and fragments were acquired over an m/z range of 350\u20131400 for 40 ms per segment. Including a 100 ms survey scan, this resulted in an overall cycle time of 2.75 s. For each biological state, 3 \u00d7 3 replicates were acquired.\nProtein identification was achieved using ProteinPilot Software version 5.0 build 4769 (Sciex) with \u201cthorough\u201d settings. A total of 322,587 MS/MS spectra from the combined qualitative analyses were searched against the UniProtKB human reference proteome (revision 02-2017, 92,928 entries) augmented with a set of 52 known common laboratory contaminants to identify 1651 proteins at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%.\nSpectral library generation and SWATH peak extraction were achieved in PeakView Software version 2.1 build 11041 (Sciex) using the SWATH quantitation microApp version 2.0 build 2003. Following retention time correction using the iRT standard, peak areas were extracted using information from the MS/MS library at an FDR of 1%. The resulting peak areas were then summed to peptide and, finally, 1495 protein area values per injection, which were used for further statistical analysis.\n2.11. Bioinformatics Analysis\nHeatmaps were generated with Morpheus ( (accessed on 26 January 2021)). Go term and network analysis was performed with the String database, and ID conversion was performed with David.\n2.12. Statistics\nAll experiments were carried out at least in biological triplicates. Error bars indicate standard deviations. Statistical significance was calculated by carrying out One-way ANOVA or Student\u2019s t-test where appropriate. The graphs were generated and statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6. The mass spectrometry data that support the findings of this study will be available at the public repository PRIDE.",

        "TITLE": "Caspase-11 drives macrophage hyperinflammation in models of Polg-related mitochondrial disease",
        "ABSTRACT": "Mitochondrial diseases (MtD) represent a significant public health challenge due to their heterogenous clinical presentation, often severe and progressive symptoms, and lack of effective therapies. Environmental exposures, such bacterial and viral infection, can further compromise mitochondrial function and exacerbate the progression of MtD. Infections in MtD patients more frequently progress to sepsis, pneumonia, and other detrimental inflammatory endpoints. However, the underlying immune alterations that enhance immunopathology in MtD remain unclear, constituting a key gap in knowledge that complicates treatment and increases mortality in this vulnerable population. Here we employ in vitro and in vivo approaches to clarify the molecular and cellular basis for innate immune hyperactivity in models of polymerase gamma (Polg)-related MtD. We reveal that type I interferon (IFN-I)-mediated upregulation of caspase-11 and guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) increase macrophage sensing of the opportunistic microbe Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in Polg mutant mice. Furthermore, we show that excessive cytokine secretion and activation of pyroptotic cell death pathways contribute to lung inflammation and morbidity after infection with PA. Our work sheds new light on innate immune dysregulation in MtD and reveals potential targets for limiting infection- and inflammation-related complications in Polg-related MtD.",
        "INTRO": "Introduction\nMitochondrial diseases (MtD) are the most common inborn error of metabolism and are caused by deleterious variants in genes that function in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance. MtD can present at any age, vary in severity, and display clinical heterogeneity with differing degrees of organ system involvement. Although the genetic basis of MtD is becoming clearer, the underlying mechanisms that cause pathology, as well as the contribution of environmental factors to disease progression, are less clear. Notably, viral and bacterial infections may unmask MtD or hasten the stepwise progression of disease by triggering metabolic decompensation, a dangerous deterioration in mitochondrial function. Clinical evidence suggests that patients with MtD are highly susceptible to infection by opportunistic respiratory pathogens. Moreover, pneumonia and microbial sepsis are the primary causes of early death in pediatric patients, and some adults, with MtD. Thus, there is ample evidence highlighting the damaging toll of infection in MtD. However, the underlying immune alterations that drive immunopathology and prevent proper control of infection represent a significant knowledge gap that complicates treatment and enhances morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable patient population.\nIn addition to their bioenergetic functions, mitochondria are key metabolic and signaling hubs in the mammalian immune system. Mitochondria are also important sources of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as mtDNA, which engage innate immune signaling when released from the organelle and are linked to inflammation in an increasing number of human diseases. There is growing appreciation for a bidirectional relationship between MtD and inflammation, where mitochondrial dysfunction in MtD activates the innate immune system leading to inflammatory responses that further compromise mitochondrial activity. In agreement with this hypothesis, elevated inflammatory cytokines have been observed in patients with Polymerase gamma (Polg)-related Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome, Barth syndrome, and Friedreich ataxia. Animal models have also revealed innate immune system dysregulation as a frequent feature of MtD. For example, the Ndufs4\u2212/\u2212 mouse model of neurodegeneration and Leigh syndrome exhibits increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines along with macrophage and microglial activation.\nWe recently uncovered that the PolgD257A mutator model of mtDNA instability exhibits a hyperinflammatory innate immune status due to chronic engagement of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)\u2014Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING)\u2014type one interferon (IFN-I) axis. Notably, we reported that persistent IFN-I signaling in these mice causes widespread repression of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in myeloid immune cells and organs of the PolgD257A mouse. Consequently, PolgD257A mice are more sensitive to septic shock caused by intraperitoneal injection of a high dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Although PolgD257A mutator mice do not phenocopy any particular human MtD, these animals present pathology overlapping the MtD spectrum, including hearing loss, cardiomyopathy, progressive anemia, and lymphopenia. Moreover, increased susceptibility to septic shock and elevated inflammatory and IFN-I signatures are common features of both Polg mutator mice and patients with diverse MtD.\nOverall, our prior work provided foundational evidence linking mitochondrial dysfunction to hyperinflammatory innate immune signaling in the PolgD257A model of MtD. However, there remains a critical need to expand these findings into relevant infection models, given the high rate of infections that frequently lead to innate immune hyperactivity and sepsis in MtD. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a common opportunistic pathogen of concern in MtD, as infection can lead to sepsis and pneumonia. PA is a robust activator of innate immunity in the respiratory tract, and lung colonization by PA drives persistent recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils leading to pneumonia, lung injury, and/or systemic bacterial spread. PA is especially problematic in MtD due to the prevalence of antibiotic resistant strains, abundance in hospitals, and high rate of recurrence. Thus, it is important to define how PA and other opportunistic bacteria engages the innate immune system in MtD to define immunomodulatory strategies that boost anti-bacterial immunity, while limiting hyperinflammation that may hasten metabolic decompensation and disease progression.\nIn this study, we utilized in vitro and in vivo PA infection models to characterize the underlying innate immune mechanisms governing hyperinflammation in PolgD257A mice. We also report a new mouse model that incorporates a pathogenic Polg variant observed in humans. We reveal that both Polg mutant models exhibit excessive macrophage inflammasome activation, cytokine secretion, and pyroptotic cell death, which contribute to inflammation, acute lung injury, and morbidity after infection with PA. These findings further advance knowledge of how mitochondrial dysfunction impacts innate immune responses during bacterial infection and Polg-related diseases and reveals innate immune targets for limiting infection- and inflammation-related complications in MtD.",
        "RESULTS": "Results\nPolgD257A mutant macrophages exhibit increased IFN-I and pro-inflammatory responses after bacterial challenge\nOur recent work uncovered that elevated IFN-I signaling augments innate immune activity and inflammation in PolgD257A mice challenged with Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist, LPS. We hypothesized that the hyperinflammatory phenotype of PolgD257A mice might be further exacerbated during bacterial infection. Therefore, we challenged bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain O1 (PAO1) (Fig. 1a) and performed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and pathway analysis (Fig. 1b). Similar to BMDMs treated with LPS, PAO1-challenged PolgD257A BMDMs displayed heightened expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IFN-I, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), and innate immune signaling factors (Fig. 1c-d; Supplementary Fig. 1a). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis confirmed PAO1-infected PolgD257A BMDMs exhibit more robust pro-inflammatory cytokine, chemokine, and IFN-I gene expression relative to wild-type (WT) BMDMs (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Additional experiments substantiated RNAseq datasets, revealing heightened expression of ISGs after challenge of PolgD257A BMDMs with PAO1 between six to twenty four hours (Fig. 1e-f). Proteomic analysis of PAO1-challenged BMDMs revealed strong concurrence with RNAseq data, showing elevated IFN-I and inflammatory responses in PolgD257A BMDMs (Fig. 1g-h, Supplementary Fig. 1c). Moreover, multi-analyte cytokine analysis by LegendPlex showed a global elevation of proinflammatory cytokines produced by PolgD257A peritoneal macrophages (PerMacs) six hours after PAO1 challenge (Fig. 1i) and ELISA showed a more rapid and sustained release of these cytokines over a one-day time course (Fig. 1j). In sum, our data highlight that PolgD257A macrophages are hyperactivated by both LPS and PAO1 challenge.\nPolgD257A mutant macrophages exhibit potentiated pyroptotic cell death upon bacterial challenge\nAs we observed increased IL-1\u03b2 secretion from PolgD257A PerMacs (Fig. 1i, k), we next investigated inflammatory cell death pathways during PAO1 infection. RNAseq and pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment of genes involved in inflammasome signaling, immunogenic cell death, and death receptor signaling in PolgD257A BMDMs after PAO1 challenge (Supplementary Fig. 1d-e). Pyroptotic cell death proteins were also highly upregulated in proteomic analysis (Fig. 1l). To further confirm a role for pyroptosis in hyperinflammation and increased cell death in PolgD257A macrophages, we incubated BMDMs with Ac-YVAD-cmk (AcYVAD), a selective caspase-1 inhibitor. AcYVAD nearly abrogated IL-1\u03b2 secretion from PolgD257A macrophages, while also reducing the levels of inflammasome-independent inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 upon PAO1 challenge (Fig. 2a). In contrast, QVD-OPH, a more potent inhibitor of apoptotic caspases, had minor effects on PAO1-induced cytokine secretion in PolgD257A BMDMs (Fig. 2a). Moreover, we did not observe striking differences in necroptotic signaling proteins during PAO1 challenge, and necrostatin-1 failed to blunt elevated cytokine secretion from PolgD257A BMDMs (Supplementary Fig. 2a-b).\nConsistent with cell death gene expression patterns, PolgD257A BMDMs more rapidly became propidium iodide (PI) positive during PAO1 challenge (Fig. 2b). PolgD257A PerMacs stained weakly for the nuclear and plasma membrane dye CellMask HCS Deep Red and exhibited rapid condensation of nuclei after PAO1 challenge (Fig. 2c-d). Reduced CellMask staining was also observed in ASC positive WT BMDMs after LPS priming and nigericin treatment (Supplementary Fig. 2c-d), indicating that low CellMask staining marks cells undergoing pyroptosis. PolgD257A BMDMs also released more lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) after PAO1 challenge (Supplementary Fig. 2e). We also noted elevated release of PAO1 into the culture supernatant from PolgD257A BMDMs, concomitant with lower numbers of intracellular bacteria (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Reduced intracellular bacteria was not the result of impaired phagocytosis, as PolgD257A BMDMs displayed no impairment in uptake of LPS coated fluorescent microspheres (Supplementary Fig. 3b-c). AcYVAD treatment was sufficient to blunt pyroptotic phenotypes of PolgD257A macrophages (Fig. 2b-d) after incubation with PAO1, further supporting a caspase-1-dependent cell death pathway.\nIn addition to activating NLRP3, PA can also activate the NLRC4 canonical inflammasome and the non-canonical caspase-11 inflammasome. Culture of PolgD257A BMDMs with non-pathogenic E. coli (DH5\u03b1), which lack flagellin and therefore can only activate NLRP3 or caspase-11, also promoted pyroptotic cell death (Supplementary Fig. 3d-e) and increased IL-1\u03b2 secretion (Supplementary Fig. 3f), while boosting TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 secretion (Supplementary Fig. 3g). Collectively, these data indicate that elevated cell death and cytokine secretion in PolgD257A macrophages during bacterial challenge are not due to PAO1 virulence factors but are likely caused by potentiated activation of NLRP3 and/or caspase-11 inflammasomes.\nElevated IFN-I enhances expression and activation of caspase-11 and caspase-1 in PolgD257A macrophages\nIn WT macrophages, PAO1 mainly engages the NLRC4 inflammasome, while activation of NLRP3 and caspase-11 inflammasomes occur at later stages of infection. Given elevated pyroptosis in PAO1-infected PolgD257A BMDMs, we next performed isolated challenge experiments to evaluate hyperactivation of particular inflammasome pathways in PolgD257A macrophages. PolgD257A BMDMs treated with LPS alone did not exhibit increased PI uptake, suggesting that priming is not sufficient to potentiate cell death (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Surprisingly, LPS priming followed by flagellin transfection to activate the NLRC4 inflammasome revealed that PolgD257A macrophages exhibit reduced PI uptake and IL-1\u03b2 secretion (Supplementary Fig. 4b-c). LPS priming followed by the addition of ATP also revealed modestly impaired NLRP3 inflammasome activation in PolgD257A BMDMs, as measured by PI uptake, IL-1\u03b2 secretion, and caspase-1 cleavage (Supplementary Fig. 4d-f). LPS priming followed by nigericin treatment revealed similar impairments in NLRP3 inflammasome activity (Supplementary Fig. 3g-i). OXPHOS has recently been shown to be vital for NLRP3 activation in response to nigericin and other stimuli. PolgD257A BMDMs displayed dysfunctional mitochondrial morphology by TEM as well as reduced basal and maximal respiration at rest and after LPS challenge (Supplementary Fig. 4j-m), suggesting that reduced canonical NLRP3 activation is likely due to OXPHOS impairment in PolgD257A BMDMs.\nAlthough PolgD257A BMDMs exhibited reduced NLRP3 and NLRC4 responses when triggered with pure inflammasome activators, mutant BMDMs displayed elevated caspase-1 and Gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage, as well as increased caspase-11 and IL-1\u03b2 expression, after incubation with PAO1 as compared with WT controls (Fig. 2e). Moreover, AcYVAD treatment inhibited the hypersecretion of IL-1\u03b2 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines in PolgD257A BMDMs challenged with PAO1 for 24 hours (Fig. 2f-g). Notably, IL-1\u03b1 secretion was markedly higher in PolgD257A macrophages after PAO1 challenge (Fig. 1i and 2f). IL-1\u03b1 is an alarmin that feeds forward to augment production of other cytokines, and the robust secretion of IL-1\u03b1 from myeloid cells involves caspase-11. Thus, given elevated caspase-11 expression in PolgD257A BMDMs, we next explored its involvement in cell death and cytokine secretion. After LPS priming followed by LPS transfection, PolgD257A BMDMs rapidly became PI positive and secreted increased levels of IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 2h-i). Both phenotypes could be markedly inhibited by treatment with AcYVAD, indicating that heightened activation of caspase-11 feeds forward to activate caspase-1 more robustly in PolgD257A BMDMs (Fig. 2h-i). Inhibition of NLRP3 with MCC950 reduced cell death and hyperinflammation in PolgD257A BMDMs after PAO1 challenge (Supplementary Fig. 5a-d). NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 activation can drive GSDMD to permeabilize mitochondrial membranes. Therefore, we isolated mitochondria from unchallenged and PAO1-challenged BMDMs and examined GSDMD accumulation in mitochondria-enriched fractions. Although there was no difference in the mitochondrial accumulation of GSDMD between genotypes, we observed markedly increased GSDMD cleavage in whole cell lysates of PolgD257A BMDMs rapidly upon PAO1 challenge (Supplementary Fig. 5e).\nAs caspase-11 activation requires IFN-I priming and PolgD257A macrophages and mice exhibit elevated IFN-I signaling, we reasoned that IFN-I is responsible for caspase-11 expression and activation in PolgD257A BMDMs. In agreement, we observed potentiated caspase-11 mRNA and protein after PAO1 infection (Fig. 1l, 2e, 2j). Notably, IFN alpha receptor (IFNAR) blockade using the MAR1-5A3 monoclonal antibody markedly reduced PI uptake after caspase-11 activation by transfected LPS (Fig. 2k). Collectively, these data indicate that the IFN-I-dependent potentiation of caspase-11 drives non-canonical caspase-1 activation and hyperinflammation in PolgD257A macrophages exposed to PAO1.\nElevated IFN-I signaling increases GBP expression and inflammation in PolgD257A macrophages.\nWe next hypothesized that elevated IFN-I may contribute to the hyperinflammatory response of PolgD257A macrophages during PAO1 infection. Priming macrophages with an anti-IFNAR antibody prior to PAO1 challenge reduced cell death and IL-1\u03b2 release in PolgD257A BMDMs (Fig. 3a-c). This blockade also reduced production of NF-\u03baB-dependent cytokines and ISG expression at the RNA level over a day time course (Fig 3d-e).\nPrior work has shown that IFN-I signaling during bacterial infection drives the expression of guanylate binding proteins (GBPs), which facilitate innate immune responses and non-canonical inflammasome activation by disrupting membranes of pathogen-containing vacuoles, or pathogens themselves, to liberate LPS or other PAMPs. Consistent with elevated IFN-I signaling, RNAseq analysis revealed more robust GBP expression in PolgD257A BMDMs after challenge with PAO1 (Supplementary Fig. 5f). Proteomics analysis also showed elevated GBPs, with marked increases in GBP2 and GBP5 in PolgD257A BMDMs six hours post challenge with PAO1 (Supplementary Fig. 5g). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed increased GBP5 expression in resting PolgD257A BMDMs (Supplementary Fig. 5h-i), as well as during PAO1 challenge (Fig. 3f-g). Notably, we observed a more robust colocalization of GBP5 with PAO1 in PolgD257A macrophages after staining with an antibody specific for PA LPS. Moreover, GBP5 staining was more aggregated on PAO1-LPS positive bacteria than in WT BMDMs (Fig. 3h). These findings suggest that elevated IFN-I in PolgD257A macrophages augments GBP expression, likely enhancing sensing of LPS via caspase-11 that contributes to potentiated cell death and pro-inflammatory cytokine release.\nCaspase-11 activation, accentuated by GBP expression, controls pyroptosis and subsequent inflammation in PolgD257A macrophages\nOur data suggest that potentiation of caspase-11-mediated pyroptosis drives excessive cell death and hyperinflammation in PolgD257A macrophages challenged with PAO1. Therefore, we hypothesized that elevated levels GBPs may contribute to the enhanced release of phagolysosomal PAO1 LPS for sensing by caspase-11 in the cytoplasm. We next used siRNA to silence caspase-11 or GBP2 and GBP5 in WT and PolgD257A BMDMs to repress this pathway. Knockdown efficiency of siRNAs was confirmed by qPCR of RNA at the time of infection (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Notably, caspase-11 silencing reduced elevated cell death, heightened cleavage of both GSDMD caspase-1, and increased secretion of IL-1 cytokines from PolgD257A BMDMs 2 hours post challenge with PAO1, while having little effect on WT BMDMs (Fig 4a-d). Similar results were obtained by silencing GBP2 and GBP5 (Fig. 4a-d). Furthermore, heightened caspase-11 association with LPS in PolgD257A BMDMs was reduced upon either caspase-11 or GBP silencing, although to a lesser extent after GBP knockdown (Fig. 4e). Caspase-11 or GBP knockdown lowered hypersecretion of proinflammatory cytokines in PolgD257A BMDMs at the twenty-four hour timepoint (Fig. 4f). Finally, we utilized an LPS-deficient PAO1 mutant to further investigate caspase-11 activation. The algC gene product is important for synthesis of the LPS core, and therefore this mutant displays altered lipid A levels and lower LPS overall, which we confirmed by LPS staining intensity as measured with an anti-PAO1 LPS antibody (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Indeed, PolgD257A BMDMs challenged with PAO1-algC displayed reduced cell death, inflammasome activation, IL-1\u03b2 release, IFN-I secretion, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (Supplementary Fig. 6c-g), further supporting that increased detection of PAO1 LPS by caspase-11 is a predominant driver of hyperinflammatory phenotypes in PolgD257A macrophages.\nIncreased intracellular availability of LPS enhances caspase-11 activation and initiation of IL-1 signaling in PolgD257A macrophages\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that while PolgD257A BMDMs have similar nuclear and cellular area at baseline (Supplementary Fig. 7a), PolgD257A BMDMs present condensed nuclei and enlarged phagolysosomes 2 hours post challenge with PAO1 (Fig. 5a-b and Supplementary Fig. 7c). Mitochondrial dysfunction can drive lysosomal defects and leakiness, and we observed abnormal phagolysosomes in PolgD257A BMDMs by TEM two hours after PAO1 (Fig. 5a-b). We also observed increased presence of vesicles adjacent to PAO1 in PolgD257A phagolysosomes, which resembled bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). At eight hours post PAO1 challenge, PolgD257A BMDMs contained more intact bacteria with OMVs that were contained in phagolysosomes with poorly defined membranes (Supplementary Fig. 7-e). This was accompanied by increased PAO1 protein expression as assessed by proteomics analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7f). Oxidative stress is a critical driver of PA OMV generation, and we noted increased reactive oxygen species and nitrite production from PolgD257A BMDMs after PAO1 challenge (Supplementary Fig. 7g). Therefore, we hypothesized that caspase-11 hyperactivity in PolgD257A macrophages may be due to increased sensing of LPS on OMVs or lingering bacteria, leading to more robust recruitment and activation of caspase-11. Quantitation of IF imaging showed a greater intensity of caspase-11 and GBP5 colocalizing with PAO1 in PolgD257A BMDMs (Fig. 5c-d), which was not observed after challenge with LPS-deficient PAO1-algC (Supplementary Fig. 7h-i). To determine if these phenotypes were in part due to LPS uptake and/or degradation kinetics, we utilized a fluorescently labeled LPS. Notably, WT and PolgD257A BMDMs took up comparable amounts of LPS after LPS priming followed by LPS transfection at acute timepoints (Supplementary Fig. 8a-b). However, we observed more fluorescent LPS in the cytosol seven hours after LPS transfection of LPS primed BMDMs (Supplementary Fig. 8c-d), as well as significantly more caspase-11 associated with LPS by IF analysis (Supplementary Fig. 8e-f). WT and PolgD257A BMDMs contained similar levels of fluorescent LPS signal immediately after passive uptake from the culture media (Supplementary Fig. 8g-h), and Polg mutant BMDMs did not release IL-1\u03b2 at early timepoints (Supplementary Fig. 8k). However, 48 hours after the addition of LPS to the cell culture media, PolgD257A BMDMs had a marked increase of cell-associated LPS (Supplementary Fig. 8i-j) and released small amounts of IL-1\u03b2 (Supplementary Fig. 8k). Together, these data suggest that elevated levels of GBPs and caspase-11 in PolgD257A macrophages, coupled with increased bacterial OMVs and LPS in the cytosol, promote enhanced caspase-11 activation, leading pyroptosis and hyperinflammation.\nIn WT macrophages, Caspase-11 and caspase-1 are not directly involved in the generation of nuclear-factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB)-dependent cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-6. Therefore, we hypothesized that elevated caspase-11 activity may potentiate autocrine or paracrine signaling via the early release of alarmins that hyperactive PA-induced IFN-I or NF-\u03baB. A kinetic stimulation study revealed increased phosphorylation of factors involved in IFN-I signaling (i.e. TBK1, STAT1) in PolgD257A BMDMs at early timepoints after PAO1 challenge, as well as elevated phospho-I\u03baB\u03b1 levels at early timepoints (Supplementary Fig. 9a). As mentioned above, IL-1\u03b1 release is associated with caspase-11 activation and GSDMD cleavage. IL-1\u03b1 signaling through the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) activates NF-\u03baB and induces transcription of pro-IL-1\u03b2, inflammasome components including NLRP3, and other proinflammatory cytokines including TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 . To determine if early caspase-11-dependent IL-1\u03b1 signaling feeds forward to potentiate cytokine secretion in PolgD257A BMDMs at later timepoints, we used a neutralizing antibody to block IL-1R signaling. Notably, the IL-1R antibody did not reduce elevated IL-1 cytokine release, cell death, or GSDMD and caspase-11 cleavage in PolgD257A BMDMs two hours post challenge (Fig. 5e-f, Supplementary Fig. 9b-c). However, IL-1R blockade was sufficient to markedly decrease IL-1 cytokines, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1 from PolgD257A BMDMs 24 hours post PAO1 challenge (Fig. 5g-h). Overall, these data indicate that the rapid, caspase-11-dependent release of IL-1\u03b1 after PAO1 challenge drives feed forward NF-\u03baB and IFN signaling to potentiate inflammatory cytokine production in PolgD257A macrophages.\nA novel PolgR292C mouse model incorporating a deleterious patient variant exhibit macrophage mtDNA depletion, elevated IFN-I responses, increased pyroptosis, and hyper-inflammation after challenge with PAO1\nTo determine if our findings in PolgD257A macrophages are more broadly applicable to other models of OXPHOS deficiency due to mtDNA perturbations, we leveraged a novel model of Polg-related mitochondrial disease harboring a single amino acid missense mutation (Arg292Cys) in exon 4 of the exonuclease domain of Polg (Supplementary Fig. 10a), which is homologous to the human Arg309Cys (c.925C>T) pathogenic variant. We generated these mice using CRISPR/Cas9 editing of ES cells and verified germline transmission of the mutation by sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 10b). The Arg309Cys variant alone or in combination with other Polg variants causes reduced mtDNA copy number, mtDNA deletions, and severe phenotypes including mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, and epilepsy in patients. Although being born below expected mendelian ratios, homozygous PolgR292C mice are viable and display a reduced mitochondrial DNA copy number and elevated ISGs in multiple tissues (Supplementary Fig. 10c-e).\nBMDMs derived from PolgR292C mice exhibited mtDNA depletion at rest (Supplementary Fig. 11a), as well as lower numbers of nucleoids and fragmented mitochondrial networks after stimulation with LPS (Supplementary Fig. 11b-c). In line with our data from the PolgD257A mutator mice, PolgR292C BMDMs displayed a constitutive elevation of ISGs at rest and potentiated ISG expression after LPS stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 10d-e). Using extracellular flux analysis, we also noted markedly reduced basal and maximal respiration after LPS stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 11f-h), indicating that PolgR292C macrophages exhibit OXPHOS deficiencies resembling those of PolgD257A BMDMs (Supplementary Fig. 4l-m).\nAfter challenge with PAO1, PolgR292C BMDMs exhibited increased ISG and GBP expression (Fig. 6a), while also secreting more cytokines over a twenty-four-hour time course (Fig. 6b). Similar to PolgD257A BMDMs, PolgR292C exhibited elevated rates of PAO1-induced cell death, IL-1 cytokine secretion, and proinflammatory cytokine production, which were blunted by treatment with caspase-1 inhibitor AcYVAD (Fig. 6c-e, Supplementary Fig. 12) or IFNAR blockade (Fig. 6f-h). Finally, silencing of caspase-11 in PolgR292C BMDMs (Fig. 6i) alleviated acute cell death (Fig. 6j-k), IL-1 release (Fig. 6l), and secretion of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 at late timepoints (Fig. 6m). These data suggest that elevated IFN-I, hyperinflammation, and pyroptosis in response to PAO1 are common features of macrophages with deficient Polg exonuclease activity, including the MtD-relevant Arg292Cys variant.\nIntratracheal instillation of a non-lethal dose of PAO1 elicits greater lung cytokine production and alterations in lung immune cell populations in PolgD257A mice\nPatients with primary MtD often experience recurrent viral and bacterial infections of the respiratory tract, including infections by PA. These events can trigger metabolic decompensation and can progress to systemic inflammatory endpoints and/or sepsis. However, few studies have examined infection kinetics and lung immune responses in Polg-related mitochondrial disorders. We therefore employed intratracheal instillation protocols to administer LPS or PAO1 into the lungs of PolgD257A mutator mice. Histological analysis of resting PolgD257A lungs did not reveal obvious differences in morphology or cellular composition (Supplementary Fig. 13a-c), although consistent with our earlier findings, basal expression of ISGs were elevated compared to WT littermates (Supplementary Fig. 13d). After LPS was instilled into lungs through cannulation of the trachea, PolgD257A mice secreted more TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 at all timepoints and increased IL-1\u03b2 at the 12-hour timepoint in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BAL) compared to WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 13e).\nTo next characterize lung innate immune responses to PAO1 infection in the PolgD257A mice, we challenged mice with a non-lethal dose of PAO1. Both WT and PolgD257A mice infected with 1x104 colony forming units (CFU) of PAO1 via intratracheal instillation lost weight initially but returned to normal weight (Supplementary Fig. 14a) and exhibited no culturable bacteria (data not shown) 3 days post infection. Flow cytometric analysis of lung cells in BAL fluid revealed an overall decrease in the percentage of CD45+ immune cells at rest and after infection, consistent with general leukopenia noted in PolgD257A mice (Supplementary Fig. 14b-c). Analysis of specific immune cell markers on lung CD45+ cells revealed few changes in BAL populations (Supplementary Fig. 14d-l) between uninfected WT and PolgD257A mice, although there were more SiglecF+ and F4/80+ cells at rest perhaps indicating elevated numbers of lung macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 14e,g). Six hours post infection, there was a marked reduction in SiglecF+ cells in PolgD257A mice relative to WTs and an increase in CD3+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. 14e,i). Cells labeling with the neutrophil marker, Ly6G, were dramatically increased at 6 hours, although there were no differences between WT and PolgD257A mice (Supplementary Fig. 14k). At 48 hours post infection, neutrophils remained the most predominant CD45+ population in both genotypes, but we observed a reversion toward increased numbers of cells staining positive for macrophage markers SiglecF+ and F4/80+ in PolgD257A mice (Supplementary Fig. 14e,g,k). Despite modest changes in cellular composition of the BAL fluid, PolgD257A mice had elevated numbers of CD45+ cells expressing TNF\u03b1 both at rest and six hours post infection (Supplementary Fig. 14m), consistent with increased TNF\u03b1 production after LPS challenge.\nMultianalyte analysis of the BAL fluid using Legendplex assays revealed 2-4 fold increases in lung pro-inflammatory cytokines in PolgD257A mice 6 hours post PAO1 infection (Fig. 7a, Supplementary Fig. 15a). Consistent with resolution of infection in both genotypes, cytokine differences in the BAL of WT and PolgD257A mice were less pronounced at 48 hours post infection (Supplementary Fig. 15b). However, IFN\u03b2 and inflammatory cytokines associated with the skewing and differentiation of T cell Th1 (IL-27) and Th17 subsets (IL-23) remained elevated in PolgD257A mice in an IFNAR-dependent fashion (Supplementary Fig. 15b). Analysis of lung protein extracts revealed elevated caspase-1 cleavage, as well as increased caspase-11, NLRC4, and NLRP3 expression in PolgD257A mice 48 hours post intratracheal instillation of 1x104 CFU of PAO1. GSDMD, GBP5, and other ISGs were also elevated in PolgD257A lungs, consistent with sustained IFN\u03b2 expression observed by Legendplex (Supplementary Fig. 15c).\nGiven that recurrent respiratory tract infections are often observed in patients with MtD, we next infected mice with 1x104 CFU PAO1, followed by a 7-day rest period, then re-infected with 1x104 CFU PAO1. Histological analysis of lungs 24 hours following re-infection revealed monocyte and granulocyte infiltration into lungs, areas of vascular hemorrhage, and more eosin positive cells in PolgD257A lungs relative to WT (Supplementary Fig. 16a-b). Lung IL-12 family cytokines and IFN\u03b2 were significantly higher in PolgD257A mice at the 24-hour harvest point following re-infection, while other cytokines were trending higher in PolgD257A mice, although they did not reach statistical significance (Supplementary Fig. 16c). We also observed higher bacterial burdens in the lungs and spleens of PolgD257A mice compared to WT controls (Supplementary Fig. 16d). Together, these data indicate that PolgD257A mice exhibit hyperinflammation and impaired antibacterial immunity upon re-infection with PAO1.\nPAO1 elicits greater caspase-11 expression, increases inflammation, and reduces survival of Polg mutant mice\nWe next utilized a higher dose of PAO1 to further assess innate immune responses Polg mutant mice. RNAseq of lung tissue collected six hours after intratracheal instillation of 1x105 CFU PAO1 revealed a striking upregulation of many inflammatory-, IFN-, and programmed cell death-related pathways in PolgD257A mice relative to WT littermates (Fig. 7b-c, Supplementary Fig. 17a). In agreement with macrophage data, transcriptional signatures of pyroptosis were apparent, with Casp11, Nlrp3, Il1a, and Il1b some of the most abundantly enriched transcripts in PolgD257A versus WT lung lysates (Fig. 7d). PolgR292C lung homogenates also displayed upregulation in transcriptional pathways indicative of hyperinflammation, elevated IFN signaling, and potentiated pyroptotic cell death 6 hours post PAO1 infection (Supplementary Fig. 17b-d). Western blotting of PolgD257A lung homogenates reinforced RNAseq data, showing increased protein expression of pyroptosis factors including caspase-11 and cleaved GSDMD (Fig. 7e), as well as a depletion in OXPHOS Complex I and IV subunits 6 hours post infection (Supplementary Fig. 17e). Moreover, PolgD257A mice exhibited elevated bacterial burdens in the lung, liver, and spleen (Fig. 7f). Increased bacterial dissemination was accompanied by elevated plasma proinflammatory cytokines, as well as elevated ISG expression with reduced OXPHOS in PolgD257A liver homogenates (Supplementary Fig. 17f-g). We next utilized the PAO1-algC mutant to further define whether reduced LPS sensing via caspase-11 would alter response to infection in PolgD257A mice. Compared to WT PAO1, PAO1-algC did not disseminate (Fig. 7g), or trigger increased expression of pyroptotic proteins and cytokines in PolgD257A lungs relative to WTs (Fig. 7h, Supplementary Fig. 17h). Overall, these data suggest Polg mutant mice display increased caspase-11-medated sensing of PAO1 LPS, elevated bacterial burdens, and hyperinflammatory responses during acute PAO1 infection\nAt later timepoints, PolgD257A lungs displayed elevated neutrophilic inflammation and overall inflammatory scores via histological analysis (Fig. 7i-j, Supplementary Fig. 17i), despite harboring similar bacterial burdens to WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 17j). However, caspase-11 and IL-1\u03b2 remained elevated in lung lysates of PolgD257A mice compared to WT littermates twenty hours post infection (Fig. 7k). Using a comprehensive health scoring system to track breathing, hydration, body appearance, and activity, we noted that PolgD257A mice appeared sicker and continued to decline in health, whereas WT animals recovered from infection (Fig. 8l). Even though we observed a steady decline in the health of PolgD257A mice at 48 hours after infection, PAO1 were largely cleared in both PolgD257A and WT animals (Supplementary Fig. 17k). However, PolgD257A mice sustained elevated ISG expression in peripheral tissues, suggesting sustained IFN-I signaling (Supplementary Fig. 17l-m). Finally, we observed that a greater number of PolgD257A mice reached a moribund state after infection with 1x105 CFU of PAO1 relative to WT littermates (Fig. 8m). Overall, these in vivo data suggest that PolgD257A mice are more prone to excessive inflammation and acute lung injury following infection with PAO1.",
        "DISCUSS": "Discussion\nPatients with MtD experience a greater frequency of bacterial and viral infections that can rapidly progress to sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), leading to premature death. Recurrent infections can also accelerate MtD progression by promoting metabolic decompensation, a life-threatening condition that hastens deterioration of mitochondrial function. Polg is the sole mitochondrial DNA polymerase, and variants in the POLG gene are a prevalent cause of MtD. There are several clinical reports of bacterial or viral infections unmasking Polg-related MtD symptoms and hastening disease progression. Moreover, one study revealed the presence of inflammatory cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with Polg-related MtD. As cytokine-mediated toxicity is an important driver of metabolic decompensation, there is a critical need to understand immune responses in patients with Polg-related disorders and other MtD to manage infections and inflammation-related complications. This study builds upon our prior work to characterize innate immune responses in mouse models of MtD and leverages bacterial infection, cytokine profiling, and in vitro and ex vivo cellular assays to define molecular and cellular nodes governing hyperinflammatory immune phenotypes in two models of Polg-related MtD (Supplementary Fig. 18).\nOur prior work revealed that elevated IFN-I responses in PolgD257A mutator mice are mediated by chronic mtDNA release and cGAS-STING signaling. Using our new, disease relevant PolgR292C mouse model, we observed increased IFN-I signatures basally and after challenge with PAO1, similar to PolgD257A. Analogous variants in human POLG at R309 affect proofreading activity, and therefore we hypothesize that the PolgR292C exonuclease mutation also impairs replication fidelity, leading to mtDNA release and chronic IFN-I signaling. A recent study reported that fibroblasts from patients carrying the POLG1 c.2243G>C, p.W748S mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS) allele display reduced IFN-I signaling in response to viral infection and nucleic acid stimuli. The MIRAS variant affects POLG holoenzyme processivity but not the exonuclease domain, and thus impaired exonuclease activity leading to mtDNA mutations and deletions may selectively trigger IFN-I in the PolgD257A and PolgR292C backgrounds. Despite reduced IFN-I, mice homozygous for the MIRAS variant do exhibit increased necroptosis, elevated liver immune cell infiltration, and potentiated inflammatory cytokine secretion during viral infection. Thus, inflammatory cell death and hyperinflammation are common features in both patient cells and mouse models of Polg-related MtD.\nOur data reveal that IFN-I signaling is a key driver of caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis and hyperinflammation in Polg mutant macrophages. Pre-treatment with an anti-IFNAR neutralizing antibody was sufficient to reduce both augmented PI uptake after LPS transfection and cytokine hypersecretion after challenge with PAO1. IFN-I is critical to license caspase-11 expression, but also to enhance expression of interferon-inducible GTPases like GBPs, which help to expose cytosolic LPS for detection. We have found that macrophages from both the PolgD257A and our new MtD-relevant PolgR292C model exhibit enhanced expression of multiple GBPs at rest and after challenge with PAO1. Moreover, we observed that GBP5 strongly co-localizes with intracellular PAO1 and caspase-11 in PolgD257A BMDMs. GBPs are important in orchestrating caspase-11 activation to bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) and can localize to damaged cell membranes. Although the mechanisms by which GBPs sense intracellular pathogens and facilitate caspase-11 activation are not fully understood, silencing of caspase-11 or GBP2 and GBP5 markedly reduced pyroptosis and the secretion of IL-1 and other cytokines from both Polg mutant BMDMs. TEM imaging also revealed altered PAO1-containing phagolysosomal membranes and increased bacteria-associated vesicles in PolgD257A BMDMs. Thus, it is likely that GBPs and caspase-11 more readily sense PAO1 LPS due to phagolysosmal leakiness, or elevated OMV generation, yet more work is required to fully define the underlying mechanisms.\nOur data reveal that Polg mutant macrophages undergo rapid pyroptosis upon PAO1 challenge in a NLRP3- and caspase-1-dependent fashion. Although caspase-1 cleavage is elevated in PolgD257A compared to WT macrophages during PAO1 challenge and its inhibition is sufficient to block augmented PA-induced cell death and IL-1\u03b2 secretion, we found that PolgD257A BMDMs are less responsive to direct activation of the NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasomes by their respective ligands. In contrast, activation of the caspase-11 inflammasome via LPS priming followed by transfection of LPS into the cytosol drove more PI uptake and IL-1\u03b2 expression in PolgD257A BMDMs. Therefore, sensing of cytosolic PA LPS by the non-canonical inflammasome leads to more robust activation of the NLRP3 for caspase-1 dependent cell death and cytokine secretion. Notably, a PAO1-algc mutant lacking robust LPS synthesis did not hyper-stimulate pyroptosis and cytokine secretion, providing further support for caspase-11 as the predominant driver of inflammatory cell death in Polg mutant mice.\nIt is interesting to note that treatment of Polg mutant macrophages with caspase-1 inhibitor dramatically reduced nearly all cytokine levels in culture supernatants after challenge with PAO1. These include inflammasome-independent cytokines such as TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IFN\u03b3, and IL-12 family members as well as the DAMP IL-1\u03b1, which does not require caspase-1 cleavage for secretion but is downstream of caspase-11 and GSDMD. This is in contrast with cytokine secretion in WT BMDMs, where AcYVAD treatment only reduced IL-1\u03b2 levels during challenge with PAO1. Similarly, anti-IFNAR blockade or caspase-11 and GBP knockdown reduced hyper-secretion of IL-1\u03b2 levels and reduced IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 in Polg macrophages, while having marginal effects on WT BMDM cytokine profiles. While blocking the IL-1R did not reduce early cell death in Polg mutant macrophages, it was sufficient to blunt elevated cytokines a day after PAO1 challenge. This suggests that early IL-1\u03b1 release downstream of capsase-11 and GSDMD synergizes with IFN-I signaling to sustain hyperinflammation in PAO1-challenged Polg mutant BMDMs. Our data do not definitively rule out contributions for canonical inflammasome-mediated IL-1\u03b2 in potentiating NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine release. However, the link between caspase-11 activation and IL-1\u03b1 suggest that the early release of this alarmin may prime neighboring cells for activation of canonical inflammasomes, further promoting increased cell death and inflammation in Polg mutant macrophages.\nAlthough it is appreciated that bacterial and viral infections are problematic in MtD, few studies have examined innate immune responses in relevant mouse models of disease. Using an intratracheal instillation model, we found that PolgD257A mice exhibit hyperactive innate immune responses resulting in elevated cytokine production, changes in lung immune cell dynamics recruitment, and increased morbidity following PAO1 infection. Notably, we observed elevated expression of inflammasome proteins including caspase-11, ISGs including GBPs, and increased caspase-1 cleavage in PolgD257A lung homogenates after infection. Remarkably, RNAseq analysis of PA infected lungs from 3-month-old PolgR292C mice also revealed increased pyroptosis, interferon, and hyperinflammatory signaling. These data agree with our in vitro findings implicating IFN-I as an overarching regulator of caspase-1/11 activation and hyperinflammation in our models. Additional studies are warranted to define the cellular populations that govern lung hyperinflammation and to determine the degree to which caspase-11 shapes inflammatory signaling and morbidity in Polg mutant mice in vivo.\nWhile PolgD257A mice had higher bacterial burdens in the lung and peripheral tissues at acute timepoints, they ultimately managed to control the infection by 20 hours post infection and cleared bacteria by 48 hours. Despite this, lungs from PolgD257A mice were more inflamed at 20 hours post infection and the mice had more severe sickness scores, resulting in higher rates of morbidity. This suggests that the adverse outcomes observed in Polg mutant animals may be due to chronic and damaging hyperinflammation as opposed to impaired bacterial clearance. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of IFN-I and caspase-11 may represent promising avenues to restore proper immune balance patients with Polg-related MtD. Although our work does not include clinical data, two recent publications revealed elevated IFN-I signatures in the whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with diverse MtD disease variants. Moreover, gene ontology analysis revealed heightened IL-1\u03b2 signatures in MtD PBMCs. Our study provides important new insight into the innate immune mechanisms governing infection-related hyperinflammation in mouse models of MtD. The consistency of our discoveries across two different Polg mutant models strengthens the relevance of our findings to human disease and suggest that IFN-I and inflammasome hyperactivity may be critical determinants of increased rates of sepsis and SIRS in patients with MtD.",

        "METHODS": "Methods\nMouse Husbandry and Strains\nC57BL/6J (JAX Stock # 000664), PolgD257A/D257A (JAX Stock # 017341), and Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 (JAX Stock # 028256) mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and bred and maintained in multiple vivaria at Texas A&M University and The Jackson Laboratory. Experimental Polg+/+ (WT) and PolgD257A/D257A littermates were obtained from PolgD257A/+ maintenance colony crosses of male PolgD257A/+ to female Polg+/+. This breeding strategy was adopted to limit the accumulation and maternal transmission of mutant mtDNA molecules to heterozygous breeders. PolgD257A/D257A mice and littermate controls used for macrophage experiments were aged for 12-16 months. PolgD257A/D257A mice and littermate controls used for in vivo infections were aged from 7-12 months.\nThe PolgR292C/R292C mouse line (B6N(Cg)-Polgem5(F290F,R292C)Lutzy/Mmjax) was generated using CRISPR/Cas9 endonuclease-mediated genome editing in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). A single guide RNA (CTCCCATCCACAGGCTGCGC) targeting exon 4 of Polg was cloned into pX459, which expresses Cas9 nuclease. This plasmid was co-delivered to JM8A3 ESCs via electroporation with a single-stranded oligonucleotide donor (ssODN) that included the missense R292C (CGC>TGC) and an additional silent mutation (F290F; TTC>TTT) to reduce recutting of the targeted allele. Following puromycin selection, resistant clones were screened for proper targeting and to exclude integration of the pX459 plasmid. Multiple clones were selected for expansion and karyotyping, and euploid clones were injected into C57BL/6J-albino blastocysts (B6(Cg)-Tyrc-2J/J; JAX STOCK# 000058) to produce chimeras. Chimeras were bred to C57BL/6NJ (JAX Stock #005304) mice and a single germline clone was selected for expansion and characterization. The line is available through the MMRRC repository (071656-JAX). All PolgR292C/R292C mice and littermate controls used for macrophage experiments were aged for 5-8 months. PolgR292C/R292C mice and littermate controls used for in vivo experiments were aged for 3-4 months. Breeding colonies of PolgR292C mice were maintained similarly to PolgD257A models. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at Texas A&M University and The Jackson Laboratory.\nIn vivo PAO1 infection\n7-12 month old mice were moved into BSL2 procedure space and allowed to acclimate for 1-2 days. Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 100-10 mg/kg Ketamine-Xylazine cocktail. Mice were then intubated with a 24G catheter. Sterile PBS (sham), 0.5 mg/kg LPS (E. Coli serotype 0111:B4; Invivogen), or the specified dose of PAO1-GFP was pipetted into the catheter in a 25-30 \u03bcL volume. A bolus of air was delivered using a syringe to ensure the dose evenly coated the lungs. Mice were kept warm until fully recovered from anesthesia and monitored daily until experimental timepoints were reached.\nBronchial alveolar lavage fluid collection\nMice were euthanized using intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg Pentobarbital Sodium to preserve the lung environment and structure of the tracheal. Upon confirmation of death the chest cavity and throat were opened. The trachea was canulated using a 23G needle threaded with tubing and the lung was washed with 3mL cold Hanks\u2019 Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 14175-129) containing 100 \u03bcM EDTA (VMR Life Science, E522) and used in subsequent flow cytometry and LegendPlex assays.\nFlow Cytometry\nBronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BAL) was spun at 350 g for 5 minutes to pellet the cells. Cells were transferred to a V bottom plate for staining. Cells were stained with viability dye then Fc receptors were blocked with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (2.4G2) antibody. Surface proteins were stained with antibodies specified in Table 6. Cells were permeabilized with Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Kit (TNB-0607-KIT, Tonbo) and stained with antibodies against intracellular proteins. Flow cytometry analysis was done using a 5L Cytek Aurora.\nColony forming unit counts from macrophages and tissues\nBMDMs or tissues were homogenized in 0.1% NP40 in sterile PBS using an immersion homogenizer for 15 seconds per tissue. Serial dilutions were plated on soy agar containing 100 \u03bcg/mL carbenicillin. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight and colonies were counted.\nHistology\nTissues were collected in cassettes, then were washed in PBS, incubated for 24 hours in 10% formalin, and transferred to 70% ethanol. Tissue embedding, sectioning, and staining were performed at AML Laboratories in Jacksonville, FL or at the histology core at Texas A&M University. Images of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were collected using an Olympus slide scanner with a 20X objective. Slides were analyzed and scored by a pathologist, Dr. Jessica Wong, at the Jackson Laboratory in Sacramento, CA. Briefly, semi-quantitative histologic scoring from 0 to 4 severity was performed on neutrophilic and mononuclear cell inflammation. 0 = no inflammation, 1 = minimal inflammation including individual cells or small clusters, 2 = mild inflammation including small clusters and increased perivascular and peribronchiolar cuffing, 3 = moderate inflammation including multifocal to coalescent areas and perivascular cuffing, and 4 = severe inflammation including coalescent to patchy-diffuse inflammation.\nBody Condition Scoring\nMice were monitored three times daily and were assigned a body condition score based on an additive score of appearance, behavior, hydration, and respiration. A score of 0 corresponds to a healthy mouse and a score of 10 corresponds to a moribund animal requiring euthanasia. Animals were given an appearance score of 0 if normal, 1 if they lacked grooming or ruffled fur, 2 if they displayed piloerection, and 3 if they displayed hunched posture. Animals were given a behavior score of 0 if they were socially active, 1 if they had decreased mobility, 2 if they showed increased isolation and only moved when prodded, and 10 if they did not ambulate with prodding. Animals were given a hydration score of 0 if the skin tent immediately returned to normal, 1 if the tent took 1-2 seconds to return to normal, 2 if the tent took greater than 2 seconds to return to normal, and 3 if this occurred accompanied by sunken and dry eyes. Animals were given a respiration score of 0 if they displayed a normal breathing pattern, 1 if they had an increased breathing rate with an abdominal component, 3 if their breathing appeared labored, and 10 if their breathing was agonal.\nCell Culture\nL929 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, D5796) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; VWR, 97068-085). Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were isolated from femurs of 6-12 month old WT, PolgD257A and 2-6 month old PolgR292C mice as described. Briefly, whole femurs were crushed in media and passed through a 70 \u03bcm filter. Red blood cells were lysed through osmosis by resuspending in ACK lysis buffer (Quality Biological, 118-156-101) for 2 minutes. Remaining cells were passed through a 40 \u03bcm filter, counted, and plated on non-tissue culture treated dishes. Macrophages were differentiated over for 7 days using 30% L929 conditioned medium. Peritoneal macrophages (PerMacs) were collected from the peritoneal cavity via gavage 4 days after intraperitoneal injection of 3% brewer thioglycolate medium (Sigma-Aldrich, B2551) and plated in in medium with 10% FBS. Unless stated, 6 x 105 BMDMs and 1.2x106 PerMacs per millimeter were used in in vitro experiments. Cells were plated and left to adhere overnight prior to challenge.\nPseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1) in vitro infection\nGFP-expressing PAO1 was provided by Dr. Carolyn Cannon and was grown on Soy agar plates (BD, 211043) with 100 \u03bcg/mL carbenicillin (Dot Scientific, 46000-5) overnight from a glycerol stock. A single colony was incubated in 5 mL Mueller Hinton broth (BD, 275730) with carbenicillin at 37 C spinning overnight. Overnight culture was back diluted 1:5 and grown for 2 hours until bacteria reached log-phase. Bacteria were washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and opsonized for 20 minutes in mouse serum (Fisher, PI31880). After two more washed with PBS macrophages were infected at the corresponding MOI and spun at 250 g for 5 minutes to synchronize infection. For inhibitor experiments, cells were primed with 10 \u03bcM Ac-YVAD-cmk (Invivogen, inh-yvad), 10 \u03bcM Q-VD-OPh (Millipore Sigma, 551476), or 10 \u03bcM MCC950 (InvivoGen inh-mcc) for 3 hours prior to challenge. For antibody blockade experiments, cells were primed with 20 \u03bcg/mL anti-IFNAR antibody (Bio X Cell, BE0241), anti-IL-1R (Bio X Cell, BE0256), or anti-IgG control (Bio X Cell, BE0083 or BE0091) antibodies for 4 hours prior to challenge. One hour after infection, wells were washed and treated with 300 \u03bcg/mL gentamicin (VWR, 0304) for 30 minutes to inactivate extracellular bacteria. The remainder of the experiment was completed with media supplemented with 50 \u03bcg/mL gentamicin and inhibitor or blocking antibody when described.\nEscherichia coli (E. coli) in vitro infection\nE. Coli containing empty pcDNA3.1 vector for antibiotic resistance was grown on LB agar plates (Fisher, DF0401-17) with 100 \u03bcg/mL carbenicillin (Dot Scientific, 46000-5) overnight from a glycerol stock. A single colony was incubated in 5 mL LB broth (Fisher, BP1427-500) with carbenicillin at 37 C spinning overnight. Overnight culture was back diluted 1:5 and grown for 2 hours until bacteria reached log-phase. Bacteria were washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and opsonized for 20 minutes in mouse serum. After two more washed with PBS macrophages were infected at the corresponding MOI and spun at 250 g for 5 minutes to synchronize infection. One hour after infection, wells were washed and treated with 300 \u03bcg/mL gentamicin (VWR, 0304) for 30 minutes to kill extracellular bacteria. The rest of the experiment was completed in DMEM + 10% FBS supplemented with 50 \u03bcg/mL gentamicin.\nInflammasome challenge\nBMDMs were primed for 4 hours with 20 ng/mL LPS-B5 Ultrapure (InvivoGen, tlrl-pb5lps). When used, caspase inhibitor Ac-YVAD-cmk (InvivoGen, inh-yvad) was added an hour after LPS, to allow for 3 hour priming, at 10 \u03bcM concentration. To trigger the non-canonical and NLRC4 inflammasomes respectively, polyethyleneimine (Alfa Aesar, 43896) was used to transfect 2 \u03bcg/mL LPS and 10 ng/mL PA flagella into the cytosol. To trigger the NLRP3 inflammasome, 5 \u03bcM ATP (Sigma, A6419) or 40 \u03bcM Nigericin (Cayman Chemical Company, 11437) was added to the media. When used, 20 \u03bcg/mL anti-IFNAR antibody (Bio X Cell, BE0241) or anti-IgG control (Bio X Cell, BE0083) were added to cells 5 hours prior to LPS priming and added again upon LPS transfection.\nImmunoblotting\nCells and tissues were lysed in 1% NP-40 lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 C and the supernatant was collected as the cellular lysate. A bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PI23235), was used to quantify protein and 10 to 40 \u03bcg total protein were loaded into 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto 0.22 \u03bcM polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were dried to return them to a hydrophobic state and then incubated in primary antibodies diluted in 1x PBS containing 1% casein overnight at 4 C rolling. Membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)- conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature, shaking. Membranes were developed with Luminata Crescendo Western HRP Substrate (Millipore, WBWR0500). Primary antibody information can be found in Table 1.\nLegendPlex multianalyte cytokine analysis\nSupernatants from macrophages were subjected to centrifugation prior to the assay to remove detached cells and debris from the sample. The assay was completed using the LegendPlex Mouse Inflammation Panel (BioLegend, 740446) according to the included protocol. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using a 5L Cytek Aurora and the BioLegend analysis software. Samples were normalized to total protein content of each sample determined by a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) protein assay and MFI from the blank control beads was subtracted to exclude background.\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\nSupernatants were collected from macrophages plated on glass coverslips. Macrophages were stained for IF analysis while supernatants were subjected to centrifugation to remove detached cells and debris from the sample. Samples were stored at \u221280C until use in this assay and were thawed on ice upon use. The assay was completed in 96-well half area clear, flat bottom plates (USA Scientific, 5667-5061) and wells were incubated overnight at 4 C in capture antibodies. Blocking was completed for one hour with PBS containing 10% FBS at room temperature. Standards and samples were added to wells for two hours. All sample dilutions were made in blocking buffer. Next, wells were incubated in detection antibody for one hour. Avidin-HRP and trimethyl boron (TMB) were used for quick color development. Plates were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 between each step. Capture and detection antibodies were used in the following pairs from BioLegend (Table 3). Samples were normalized to corresponding nuclei counts from 20X IF images taken on an EDLIPSE Ti2 (Nikon). Nuclei counts were determined using the automated bright spot counting function in NIS-Elements on DAPI and an average of 3 images was used to normalize ELISA. Normalization of BAL from PAO1-algC infected mice was normalized to protein concentration. ELISA concentrations were determined using an epoch plate reader (BioTek) and BioTek Gen5 software. Normalized results were graphed in GraphPad.\nQuantitative polymerase chain reaction\nRelative gene expression with measured by qRT-PCR in cells. Total cellular RNA was isolated using Quick-RNA microprep kit (Zymo Research, R1051). Approximately 0.5 \u03bcg of RNA was used to make cDNA with XLT qScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quantabio, 95047). cDNA was then used in a qPCR assay using PerfeCTa Green FastMix (Quantabio, 95071). Two to three biological replicates and two to three technical replicates were normalized to Rpl37 cDNA using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method. All primer sequences can be found in Table 4.\nImmunofluorescence (IF) imaging\nCells were seeded at 2.5x105 cell/well in a 24 well plate and allowed to grow overnight on glass coverslips sterilized with ethanol. After challenge or infection, cells were washed in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes. Next cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 minutes, blocked with PBS containing 5% FBS for 30 minutes, stained with primary antibodies (table 2) for 1 hour, stained with secondary antibodies for 1 hour, and stained with 200 ng/mL 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (ThermoFisher Scientific, 62247) for 2 minutes. When described, coverslips were stained with 2 \u03bcg/mL CellMask (ThermoFisher Scientific, C10046) for 10 minutes after secondary antibody staining and washed multiple times in PBS before DAPI staining. Coverslips were mounted with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen, MP33025) and sealed with nail polish. Cells were imaged with a 40x or 60x oil-immersed objective with an ECLIPSE Ti2 widefield microscope (Nikon) and analyzed with the NIS-Elements AR 5.21.02 software.\nQuantification was done from multiple intensity projection (MIP) images generated from Z-stacks. MIPs were made and analysis was done using NIS-Elements AR 5.21.02. Specifically, cell death was determined using the automated bright spot counting function in NIS-Elements on DAPI to count the number of nuclei. Dying cells were manually determined by identifying cells with condensed nuclei and low CellMask staining. Percentage of dying cells were determined and graphed in GraphPad.\nProtein intensities were quantified by thresholding a mask over each channel and exporting sum intensities and area of masks. The sum intensities were normalized to area or cell numbers where described. When normalized to cell number, cells were counted using the automated bright spot counting function in NIS-Elements on DAPI. To quantify intensities of colocalized proteins, a mask was generated over each protein. Next, a new mask was made for the overlap of these channels and the intensity and area of each channel in this mask was exported and graphed.\nTo quantify nucleoids, whole cells were outlines and made into a region of interest (ROI) and these ROIs were numbered. A thresholding mask was made on the channels with TFAM and DNA staining and channel intensities were determined for these masks and graphed. A new mask was made based on the overlap of TFAM and DNA. The area of this mask and number of spots per ROI were exported and graphed in GraphPad. Graphs and statistics were generated in GraphPad. Huygens Essential software (v21.4.0) was used to deconvolve representative images from z-stacks taken with a 60X objective in oil immersion.\nLactate dehydrogenase release\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured in the supernatant of PAO1 challenged macrophages using a LDH-Cytox Assay Kit (Biolegend, 426401) according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. A set of cells were treated with 1% Triton X-100 and the supernatant was used to determine total cellular LDH.\nPI uptake\nBMDMs in 96 well half area glass bottom imaging plates were seeded at 6x104 cells/well in 50 \u03bcL of Phenol-Red free DMEM + 10% FBS. The next day, cells were subjected to inflammasome challenge or infection with PAO1. Propidium iodide (PI, Alfa Aesar, J66584) was added to media and plates were immediately imaged every ten minutes using a BioTek Cytation V imager which maintains 37 C and 5% CO2. PI positive nuclei were identified and counted using BioTek Gen5 software. Control wells treated with PI and Triton X-100 (to permeabilize cells) to for normalization. The difference between PI positive cells compared to the initial reading were graphed in line graphs using GraphPad Prism.\nCell fractionation and mitochondrial enrichment\nMacrophages were lifted from cell culture dishes in PBS using a cell scraper. Cells were washed with PBS and then resuspended in Resuspension buffer (10 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 10 mM Tris-Hcl, pH 7.5) with phosphatase and protease inhibitors. A dounce homogenizer was used to break cell membranes and liberate organelles. Mitochondria were bound to magnetic beads coated with TOMM20 antibodies isolated using a mitochondria isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, 120-009-492). The remaining cell components and unbound mitochondria were pelleted and run as the cellular fraction. All samples were lysed in 1% SDS lysis buffer and run on a western blot for analysis.\nSeahorse assay\nMitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in BMDMs were measured using a Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer. Macrophages were plates at a denisity of 5x105 cells/well in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% L929 in an Agilent Seahorse XF96 Cell Culture Microplate. When described, 20 ng/mL LPS was added 16 hours prior to analysis. Cells were placed in XF assay medium immediately before analysis. ECAR and OCR measurements were recorded through sequential addition of 10 mM glucose, 1.5 \u03bcM oligomycin, 1.5 \u03bcM carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone with 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and finally 833 nM antimycin A plus 833 nM rotenone. Data was analyzed and calculations were made according to.\nsiRNA knock down in bone marrow derived macrophages\nBone marrow was isolated from mice as described above. On day four, macrophages were moved to 10 cm dishes. On day five, macrophages were transfected with 25 nM of Negative Control (51-01-14-03), mm.Ri.Casp4.13.1, mm.Ri.Gbp2.13.1, or mm.Ri.Gbp5.13.1 DsiRNAs (IDT) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (ThermoFisher Scientific, 13778100) in OPTIMEM (Gibco, 51985-034) according to company recommendations. Six hours after transfection, media was removed and replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS, 5% L929, and 20 \u03bcg/mL anti-IFNAR antibody (Bio X Cell, BE0241) to reduce IFN-I-mediated toxicity due to siRNA transfection. A day after transfection, cells were replated in cell culture plates in macrophage media without anti-IFNAR antibody, then used in infection experiments the next day as described above.\nmtDNA copy number analysis\nDNA was isolated from cell pellets or crushed tissues by boiling for 30 minutes in 50 mM NaOH lysis buffer and then neutralizing using 1 M Tris, pH8 solution. DNA was diluted to 2 ng/uL and utilized in qRT-PCR reaction (described above) with mtDNA specific primers. Two to three biological replicates and two to three technical replicates were normalized to nuclear encoded Tert using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method. All primer sequences can be found in Table 5.\nTransmission electron microscopy\nMacrophages were lifted from cell culture dishes and pellets were fixed for 1 hour in 4% PFA. After fixation, cells were rinsed in 0.1M cacodylate buffer and then post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO4) in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells were rinsed again in the same buffer then spun down into pellets with 2% liquid agarose in distilled water and placed in a 4 C refrigerator for 30 minutes, allowing the agarose to harden. After trimming the agarose cell pellets, samples were transferred through graded ethanol (40% ETOH to 100% ETOH), propylene oxide, and then infiltrated with 1:1 propylene oxide:Embed 812 resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) overnight, 1:3 propylene oxide:Embed 812 resin for 4 hours, and finally 100% Embed 812 resin overnight. Tissues were embedded in 100% resin in beam capsules and cured at 65\u00b0C for 48 hours prior to sectioning. Thin sections (90 nm) were cut on a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL.) with a diamond knife, placed onto 300 mesh copper grids and stained using 2% uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate. Samples were evaluated at 80 kV using a JEOL JM-1230 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) and images collected with an AMT Nanosprint15 MK-11 sCMOS digital camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Woburn, MA.). Image quantification of cellular and PAO1 areas were completed in using NIS-Elements AR 5.21.02.\nRNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis\nTotal cellular RNA was prepared from uninfected BMDMs and infected BMDMs using Quick-RNA microprep kit (Zymo Research, R1051) and used for the next-generation RNA-sequencing procedure at Texas A&M University Bioinformatics Core. BaseSpace Sequence Hub (Illumina) was used for RNA seq analysis. Briefly, Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) algorithm of RNA-seq Alignment V2.0.0 software was used to align the results to reference genome Mus musculus/mm10 (RefSeq), and then RNA-seq Differential Expression V1.0.0 software was used to obtain raw gene expression files and determine statistically significant changes in gene expression in Polg mutant macrophages relative to WT. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (QIAGEN) was used to identify gene families and putative upstream regulators in the datasets. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) Software (Broad Institute) was used to generate enrichment plots and examine pathway enrichment. Heatmaps were generated using GraphPad Prism. Datasets of LPS-treated PolgD257A BMDMs used in Fig. 1-2 and Supplementary Fig. 1 were previously reported and are available under Gene Expression Omnibus number GSE171960. Normalized gene counts from PAO1-infected PolgD257A BMDMs are supplied for review in a supplemental data spreadsheet (see Dataset 1 Excel file). These data will be deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus upon acceptance of the paper for publication.\nRNA sequencing of lungs was performed by isolating total cellular RNA from infected lungs using a Direct-zol RNA miniprep Plus kit (Zymo Research, R2072). Next-generation RNA-sequencing was performed by The Jackson Laboratory Genomic Technologies Core. Partek Flow (v12.3.0) was used for RNA seq analysis. Briefly, Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) algorithm of RNA-seq Alignment was used to align the results to reference genome Mus musculus/mm10 (RefSeq), and then RNA-seq Differential Expression software analysis was used to obtain raw gene expression files and determine statistically significant changes in gene expression in Polg mutant macrophages relative to WT. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (QIAGEN) was used to identify gene families and putative upstream regulators in the datasets. Heatmaps were generated using GraphPad Prism. Normalized gene counts from PAO1-infected PolgD257A lungs and PAO1-infected PolgR292C lungs are supplied for review in a supplemental data spreadsheet (see Dataset 2 Excel file). These data will be deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus upon acceptance of the paper for publication.\nIn vitro proteomic and bioinformatic analysis\nCell sample protein extraction and quantification.\nThe adherent cells were washed on the six-well culture plate with PBS (+calcium and magnesium) three times. After washing the cells, 250 \u03bcL of 6M Urea in 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0 was added to each well. Cells were scraped from the plate and the solution was transferred to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. Samples were then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and transferred to the Mass Spectrometry and Protein Chemistry Service at The Jackson Laboratory for further processing. Each tube had a pre-chilled 5 mm stainless steel bead (QIAGEN) added and were lysed with the Tissue Lyser II (QIAGEN) for 2 minutes at 30 1/s. A magnet was used to remove the stainless steel beads and each sample was further lysed using a 1 mL syringe with a 23-gauge needle for 10 passes. Samples were then ice-waterbath sonicated at 37 Hz (100% power; Firsherbrand FB11207) for 5 minutes (30 seconds on, 30 seconds off for five cycles). The cell lysates were then centrifuged at 21,000 x g at 4\u00b0C for 15 minutes and the supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. A small fraction of the sample was then used to create a 1:50 dilution (sample:50 mM HEPES) and a microBCA assay (Thermo) was run for protein quantification according to the manufacturer protocol.\nFor each of the quantified cellular protein lysates, 20 \u03bcg of protein was diluted in 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0 to bring the urea concentration less than 2M for the trypsin digest. Each sample was then reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (final concentration) for 30 minutes at 37oC for 30 minutes in a ThermoMixer (500 rpm agitation). Samples were then cooled to room temperature and alkylated with 15 mM iodoacetamide for 20 minutes at 21oC in a ThermoMixer (500 rpm agitation). Sequence grade modified trypsin (Promega) was then add at a 1:40 ratio (trypsin:protein) to each sample for digestion at 37oC for 20 hours. Millipore C18 zip-tips (Millipore, ZTC18S096) were then used to desalt and purify the peptide digests according to the manufacturer protocol. All purified peptide samples were then dried using a vacuum centrifuge. Dried peptide digests were reconstituted in 20 \u03bcL of 98% H2O/2% ACN with 0.1% formic acid via pipetting up and down 10 times, followed by vortexing at max speed for 30 seconds. Reconstituted samples were centrifuged at low speed for 15 seconds on a tabletop minicentrifuge to collect the liquid from the walls in the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube. All liquid was then transferred to a mass spec vial (Thermo) and placed in the Vanquish Neo (Thermo) liquid chromatography autosampler set to 4oC.\nLiquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry Analysis\nData independent acquisition mass spectrometry analysis (DIA-MS) was performed on a Thermo Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer coupled to the Vanquish Neo liquid chromatography system with an EASY-Spray column (PepMap Neo C18, 75 \u03bcm x 150 mm, #ES75150PN) in the Mass Spectrometry and Protein Chemistry Service at The Jackson Laboratory. Each sample had two technical replicate runs consisting of an 8 \u03bcL injection of reconstituted sample. Before each sample injection the separation column underwent fast equilibration in the method using pressure control at 1500 bar and an equilibration factor of three column volumes. The trapping column underwent fast wash and equilibration using a was factor of 100, an automatic equilibration factor, and flow control at 120 uL/minute. The method gradient was 25 minutes after the column equilibration using Buffer A (100% H2O with 0.1% formic acid) and Buffer B (100% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) with a flow rate of 600 nL/min. The full gradient consisted of 2% B to 4% B from 0-2.5 minutes, 4% B to 6% B from 2.5-4.5 minutes, 6% B to 30% B from 4.5-22.5 minutes, and 30% B to 90% B from 22.5-24 minutes while ramping to 1 \u03bcL/minute flow rate in the last step. The column was then washed with 90% B at 1 \u03bcL/minute from 24-25 minutes. Orbitrap Astral settings included a static spray voltage using the NSI source at 2000 V in positive mode, an ion transfer tube temperature of 325oC, an expected peak width of 10 seconds, advanced peak determination, a default charge state of 2, EASY-IC lock mass correction, and RunStart mode. Full scan settings in positive mode included an orbitrap resolution of 240,000, scan range of 380-980 m/z, RF lens at 60%, normalized AGC target of 500% with an absolute AGC value of 5e6, and a maximum injection time of 5 ms. DIA method settings included a precursor mass range of 380-980 m/z, an isolation window of 2 m/z with no overlap, normalized HCD collision energy of 25%, detector type set to Astral with a scan range of 150-2000 m/z, RF lens at 60%, normalized AGC target of 500% with an absolute AGC value of 5e4, maximum injection time of 5 ms, and loop control set at 0.6 seconds.\nDIA-MS data analysis\nAll Orbitrap Astral RAW data files underwent automatic processing through the Thermo Ardia Server and were directly sent to the Proteome Discoverer 3.1 workstation connected to the system. The RAW data files for each sample were searched against the UniProtKB Mus musculus (sp_tr_incl_isoforms TaxID=10090; v2024-05-01) protein database in Proteome Discoverer (version 3.1) using the CHIMERYS Ardia Server searching algorithm with the inderys 3.0 fragmentation prediction model. Search settings included trypsin digestion, a maximum missed cleavage of one, peptide length of 7-30 amino acids, peptide charge from 1-4, a fragment mass tolerance of 10 ppm, a dynamic oxidation of methionine modification (+15.995 Da), a static carbamidomethlyl modification of cysteine (+57.021 Da), and a false discovery rate of less than 0.05 for all matches; all other settings were set to manufacturer default recommendations. Total peptide amount was then utilized to normalize the ion signal in the samples. Quantification analyses settings included the use of unique peptides for quantification and a protein abundance-based ratio calculation was used for the summed abundances, followed by a background based t-test. Strict parsimony principle was then applied for protein grouping and master proteins were reported. The data was also run with no imputation and low abundance resampling imputation for comparison during the analysis process. The full dataset can be found in the Proteome Exchange PRIDE upload XXXXXXXXXX (number will go here when published, see Dataset 3 Excel file).\nStatistical Analyses\nTo ensure rigor and reproducibility, experiments were repeated at least three times with multiple biological replicates. Error bars displayed throughout the manuscript represent the mean +/\u2212 s.e.m. Statistical significance between 2 groups was determined via unpaired, two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test or Mann-Whitney test, and differences between 3 or more groups was determined by two-way ANOVA with appropriate post-test. Survival plots were compared by the Log-rank test. Sample sizes were chosen by started methods to ensure adequate power, and no randomization or blinding was used for animal studies. Significance was established as * p<0.05; ** p<0.01; *** p<0.001; **** p<0.0001; or not significant (n.s.).",

        "TITLE": "Challenging the Astral mass analyzer to quantify up to 5,300 proteins per single cell at unseen accuracy to uncover cellular heterogeneity",
        "ABSTRACT": "Despite significant advancements in sample preparation, instrumentation and data analysis, single-cell proteomics is currently limited by proteomic depth and quantitative performance. Here we demonstrate highly improved depth of proteome coverage as well as accuracy and precision for quantification of ultra-low input amounts. Using a tailored library, we identify up to 7,400 protein groups from as little as 250\u2009pg of HeLa cell peptides at a throughput of 50 samples per day. Using a two-proteome mix, we check for optimal parameters of quantification and show that fold change differences of 2 can still be successfully determined at single-cell-level inputs. Eventually, we apply our workflow to A549 cells, yielding a proteome coverage ranging from 1,801 to a maximum of >5,300 protein groups from a single cell depending on cell size and search strategy used, which allows for the study of dependencies between cell size and cell cycle phase. Additionally, our workflow enables us to distinguish between in vitro analogs of two human blastocyst lineages: naive human pluripotent stem cells (epiblast) and trophectoderm-like cells. Our data harmoniously align with transcriptomic data, indicating that single-cell proteomics possesses the capability to identify biologically relevant differences within the blastocyst.\nAn ultra-low-input single-cell proteomic workflow is optimized to yield maximum proteome coverage with high accuracy and precision on the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer.",
        "INTRO": "Main\nSingle-cell proteomics (SCP) by mass spectrometry (MS) has evolved into a powerful technique to investigate cellular heterogeneity with increasing coverage and throughput. To tackle the challenge of ultra-low input amounts, a multitude of miniaturized and automatized sample preparation workflows have been developed by several labs. The success of SCP, however, is also tightly connected to technological improvements in high-performance nanoflow liquid chromatography (LC) and high-resolution, high-sensitivity MS. The SCP field initiated its success by using isobaric labels for multiplexing to improve sensitivity and throughput. With more sensitive and fast mass spectrometers being commercialized, more and more groups focus on label-free quantitation workflows and use data-independent acquisition (DIA) combined with short LC gradients. With these DIA workflows, optimal reproducibility across runs is achieved while maintaining throughput at acceptable levels ranging from 40 to up to 180 samples per day (SPD). Improvements in data analysis algorithms allow for confident identification of very-low-abundance peptides hidden within highly chimeric spectra.\nThe recent introduction of the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer further extends the reachable sensitivity and acquisition speed by combining the established Thermo Scientific Orbitrap analyzer with the newly developed Thermo Scientific Astral analyzer in a single instrument. The Astral analyzer combines high speed (up to 200\u2009Hz) at high resolution and sensitivity, with nearly lossless transmission and a high dynamic range. The instrument allows for high acquisition speed by simultaneously using the Orbitrap analyzer for MS1 spectra and the Astral analyzer for MS2 spectra at a resolution sufficient to resolve tandem mass tag reporter ions and at a sensitivity superior to the Orbitrap analyzer.\nHere, we investigate the performance of the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer in combination with the Aurora Ultimate TS 25-cm nanoflow ultra-high-performance LC (UHPLC) column that comes with a fully integrated source interface to minimize peak broadening and yield the highest possible signal intensity. We optimize the gradient length to yield maximum proteome coverage and assess the accuracy and precision of quantification.\nWe apply our improved workflow to investigate the cellular heterogeneity of A549 human lung cancer cells. Additionally, we used optimized SCP on naive human pluripotent stem (hPS) cells, which recapitulate the preimplantation epiblast (EPI), and trophectoderm (TE)-like cells differentiated from naive hPS cells. During the in vitro fertilization process, only about 40% of fertilized eggs are estimated to reach the blastocyst stage with sufficient quality for transfer to the mother\u2019s uterus. The criterion for selecting blastocysts largely depends on morphological characteristics, such as the expansion of the outer TE and a well-clustered inner EPI population. However, our understanding of the mechanisms regulating blastocyst morphology remains limited. This limitation is primarily due to restricted access to human embryos and the lack of technologies capable of low-input detection methods. In this context, high-sensitivity SCP emerges as a powerful tool. It holds promise for unraveling the mechanisms underlying the regulation and functionalization of blastocyst morphology, including aspects like TE epithelialization, cavity formation and tissue segregation between the EPI and TE.",
        "RESULTS": "Results\nReaching unprecedented proteomic coverage\nWe combined the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer with the Thermo Scientific field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) Pro interface and the Auroa Ultimate 25-cm TS column with an integrated emitter tip and zero dead volume, aiming to maximize sensitivity for ultra-low-input proteomic samples. To have a representative standard of comparable input to a single cell for evaluation and benchmarking, we decided to inject 250\u2009pg of commercial HeLa and K562 cell peptides. The bulk digests were diluted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) containing 0.015% N-dodecyl-\u03b2-d-maltoside (DDM) to improve peptide solubility, reproducibility and quantitation accuracy. Gradient lengths were varied from 14 to 38\u2009min (Supplementary Table 1), which corresponds to reachable throughputs of 30\u201380 SPD, including sample loading as well as column equilibration and washing time. During loading and washing, flow rates were increased to improve throughput, and lower flow rates were applied during peptide elution to enhance sensitivity. As shown in Fig. 1a,e, we found a sweet spot around 50 SPD, yielding maximal identifications. Of note, the data were analyzed library free. When replicates were searched together, the number of protein groups (PGs) identified was boosted by 6.3\u201310.9% and 4.5\u20137.2% for HeLa cell peptides and K562 cell peptides, respectively. In addition, by allowing for matching, replicate measurements nicely align, leading to a data completeness close to 100% and vanishing error bars for ID numbers compared to the method evaluation mode.\nBased on our results, we hypothesize that shorter gradients are advantageous for ultra-low-input samples as they produce sharper, and hence more intense, chromatographic elution peaks. Once a maximum is reached at 50 SPD, faster gradients potentially suffer from insufficient separation power and greater spectrum complexity, which adversely affects identification numbers. Fast gradients with very narrow elution peaks further reduce the number of data points per peak (Fig. 1c,g). We decided to focus on 50 SPD as the gradient length for all further experiments within this study as it still shows the best proteome coverage with five data points per peak on median (MS1 level), enough for proper integration. We further decided to quantify on the MS1 level as we see not only more data points there but also a lower median coefficient of variation (CV) clearly below 10% (Fig. 1b,f).\nNext, we created a tailored library from 10\u2009ng of the very same HeLa and K562 digests to further improve proteome coverage. The libraries were also recorded in DIA mode and resulted in more than 62,000 precursors identified within the library (Fig. 1d,h). Using these libraries, we performed a library search for the 250-pg runs, which improved PG identifications by 41.5% and 31.7% compared to a library-free search in method evaluation mode and by 26.3% and 25.6% compared to the library-free search with matching for HeLa and K562 cell peptides, respectively (Fig. 1d,h). Using default settings for the Spectronaut search engine, we identified more than 7,500 proteins from a single run with as little as 250\u2009pg of HeLa cell peptide input and more than 6,800 proteins with 250\u2009pg of K562 cell peptides. These numbers increased further to a total of 7,800 and 7,060 unique PGs identified from three replicates of HeLa and K562 cell peptides, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). Of note, we identified a total number of 6,126 PGs from HeLa cell peptides using DirectDIA+ in method evaluation mode and only 6,017 using DirectDIA+ with matching replicates (DirectDIA+). We hypothesize that this is reasoned by a global false discovery rate (FDR) control applied over all three replicates on top of the run-specific control while only very few additional proteins could be matched in those technical replicates. Of those 6,017 total proteins, 5,989 were found in all replicates, indicating excellent data completeness (Supplementary Fig. 1a). We additionally checked for potential FDR inflation by using a library to boost ID numbers and performed a cosearch of 250-pg and 10-ng files instead (Supplementary Fig. 1c). When doing so, the PG numbers were similar to each other (difference of ~0.4%), and at the precursor level, the difference was ~5%, suggesting that FDR inflation is no problem in the Spectronaut version used (18.6).\nImportantly, our results depicted a single hit wonder and were also successfully reproduced on a second Orbitrap Astral run using a different batch for the analytical column and K562 digest (Supplementary Fig. 1d).\nTo exclude potential issues occurring from carryover when using shorter gradients, we assessed the degree of residual protein and precursor identifications in the first five washes after 250-pg injections. (Supplementary Fig. 2). In method evaluation mode, we were not able to identify any proteins in wash runs where only 0.1% TFA was injected, as too little spectra for calibration were available. When allowing for matching across the recorded replicates, the first wash run after a sample injection yielded <2% of precursor IDs compared to the previous 250-pg injection. The total quantity of protein in those first washes was more than two orders of magnitude lower than the previous 250-pg injections independent of the gradient length used. Although those quantities are further reduced following continued washing, we conclude that the level of carryover is neglectable for such single-cell-level samples and for the throughput range tested in this study. Furthermore, we did not see any accumulation of material on the column over time (that is, no increase in quantity from the first to fifth replicate of a 250-pg injection; Supplementary Fig. 2c).\nWe assume that 250\u2009pg of HeLa cell peptides is equivalent to single-cell-level input for methodological comparisons in this study; however, protein contents ranging from 100 to 500\u2009pg were reported for HeLa cells depending on their size and cultivation time. We therefore checked reachable proteome coverage for a broader range of input amounts ranging from 50\u2009pg to 10\u2009ng (relevant when using libraries or carrier proteomes). This resulted in ~4,700 to ~8,300 PGs identified from 50\u2009pg to 10\u2009ng, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3). To consider the large difference in sample input, we adopted an isolation window and maximal injection time ranging from 5 to 20\u2009Th and 10 to 80\u2009ms, respectively. We consider such an adoption as highly relevant also for the generation of tailored libraries from higher input (see Fig. 4 without an adopted acquisition method and Fig. 5 with an adopted acquisition method for real single cells).\nValidation of the FDR strategy\nTo estimate the real FDR, we generated a shuffled target database by shuffling all sequences of our target database while maintaining the positions of all protease cleavage sites (P, K and R). Both databases were used as targets in the subsequent search. They have less than 0.01% shared peptides and a similar size, allowing for a fair FDR estimation with a very low risk of finding peptides in the shuffled target database that represent true-positive hits (Fig. 1i). Of note, randomization of peptide sequences led to a slightly increased number of unique peptides in the shuffled target versus the target database, which we opted for deliberately to ensure a conservative estimate of the FDR.\nWhen examining the HeLa cell data presented in Fig. 1d, we found that the FDR at the PG level was slightly above the expected 1%, indicating that default settings in Spectronaut version 18 are too relaxed (Fig. 1k). This is in line with earlier results demonstrated in Spectronaut versions 16 and 17, where the FDR was reported to be higher than expected when using default parameters.\nWe additionally used a Caenorhabditis elegans database as a second entrapment strategy for FDR validation (Fig. 1j). The estimated FDR when using C. elegans as entrapment was a bit higher and above 2%, confirming our initial observation of potentially too relaxed settings. We therefore tested the application of a more stringent cutoff of 0.01 for the run-wise protein q value, which did, however, not alter the results. Instead we applied fully stringent settings suggested by Baker et al.. Their optimized settings set all cutoff values to 0.01. As shown in Fig. 1d,h, the additional protein q value cutoff did not change the results in DirectDIA mode, and numbers dropped only slightly for the library search. Using the settings suggested by Baker et al., PG numbers for HeLa cells dropped by ~3% for runs in DirectDIA+ and by ~16% for library searches.\nOf note, reporting total ID numbers by summing up all unique IDs from three replicates (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b), without an additional FDR filter step, further accumulates wrongly identified precursors and proteins. This leads to an elevated FDR of up to 5.5% (Supplementary Fig. 1e). Hence, we advise reporting average ID numbers rather than total ID numbers.\nThe FAIMS Pro interface improves signal to noise, CV and coverage\nAiming for the best possible sensitivity, we screened for the optimal compensation voltage in high FAIMS using the FAIMS Pro interface. From previous experience, \u201348\u2009V yields optimal results on the used device, which is why that voltage was used for all other runs. Screening the compensation voltage from \u201338 to \u201388\u2009V in steps of 10 suggests that the optimal setting is between \u201348 and \u201368\u2009V, with few more PGs and clearly more precursors detected at \u201358\u2009V than at any other setting. Although using the FAIMS Pro interface bears the risk of losing some ions, it still seems advantageous due to an improved signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range. As reported earlier by our lab, a clear gain in sensitivity, especially for limited-sample LC\u2013MS/MS analyses, can be seen by using the FAIMS Pro interface, as the relative contribution of singly charged background ions gets more substantial at low sample loads.\nIn our hands, use of the FAIMS Pro interface at optimal settings resulted in a clearly improved signal-to-noise ratio (Supplementary Fig. 4), with up to 42.6% more precursors and 55.3% more PGs identified than measurements without a FAIMS interface (Fig. 2a). In line with our expectation from the improved signal-to-noise ratio, we quantified more low-abundance precursors/proteins when using FAIMS (Fig. 2d,e). However, some of the abundant precursors were lost, resulting in only 49% and 63% of peptides identified in runs without FAIMS being found at the most promising compensation voltages of \u201348\u2009V and \u201358\u2009V, respectively (Fig. 2f). Among shared peptides between runs without the FAIMS Pro interface and with a compensation voltage of \u201348\u2009V, fewer close to 0 or missed values were present in the data recorded with the FAIMS interface (Supplementary Fig. 5b,c). Almost all (98%) peptides found in runs without FAIMS were present in one of the compensation voltage runs (Supplementary Fig. 5a). The observed effect was less dramatic at the protein level, where almost all proteins quantified without FAIMS were also quantified with FAIMS (Fig. 2g). In addition, FAIMS usage yielded more identified proteins. Global sequence coverage with FAIMS was slightly reduced (that is, on average, 7.8 peptides/protein were identified without FAIMS but only 7.6 and 6.0 peptides/protein at compensation voltages of \u201348\u2009V and \u201358\u2009V, respectively). Acquisition speed was also not affected as there was no influence on the number of data points per peak (Fig. 2c), and the CV (Fig. 2b) was strongly improved by FAIMS. Overall, we believe that FAIMS usage is highly advantageous for most single-cell studies mainly due to the improvement of signal-to-noise and CV that results in more proteins being identifiable and quantifiable.\nQuantitative performance\nWe next evaluated the quantitative performance of our workflow at single-cell-level inputs and benchmarked the data to our Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer using similar settings, the same input and the same gradient length.\nAlthough the CV gives a reasonable estimate of the quantitative precision across technical replicates, we further evaluated the accuracy and precision of proteins quantified from a two-proteome mix (Fig. 3). By comparing two proteome mixes with different, but known, human-to-yeast mixing ratios, we assessed the accuracy of quantification. Of note, less than 50\u2009pg of yeast, present in one of the samples, still enabled the quantification of 1,782 yeast proteins. As shown in Fig. 3a, the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer does an excellent job delivering a fold change in protein abundance very close to the expected value and outperforms the Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer, especially for the more sparse yeast samples (Fig. 3). We further checked accuracy by looking at the distribution around the expected fold change and found that higher-abundance proteins within our sample tended to be quantified very accurately with a local CV of less than 5%. The local CV, however, rose with lowered protein abundance and approached 35% at the limit of quantification. We observed an exponential drop of CV with increasing protein abundance.\nOur results show that on the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer, more than twice the number of proteins was quantified compared to on the Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer, which is likely due to its improved speed and sensitivity. When filtering for commonly found proteins (Fig. 3b,h,i), predominantly lower-abundance proteins were missing, highlighting the increased sensitivity of the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer. Furthermore, almost all proteins identified with the Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer were also identified using the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer. The number of common proteins was very close to the protein number quantified using the Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer. The commonly quantified proteins allow for a fair comparison of accuracy and precision between the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer and the Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer and shows that the distribution of fold change values is clearly smaller on the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer. The same is true for the local CV and is most distinct for the proteins of lowest abundance, where the CV drops from ~20% for the Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer to ~12% for the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer. Because quantification was performed at the MS1 level, data from both instruments originated from an Orbitrap analyzer of the same construction type. We hypothesized that the increased CV even for the very same proteins is due to the lower speed of the Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer. The Orbitrap Exploris mass spectrometer uses the Orbitrap analyzer for both MS1 and MS2 data acquisition, whereas the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer simultaneously uses the Orbitrap analyzer for MS1 and the Astral analyzer for MS2, which gives the latter an enormous advantage in speed. This is also reflected in more data points per elution peak recorded on the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer (median of three for Exploris and five on the Astral for this dataset).\nApplying an additional filter to exclude proteins quantified based on only one peptide had no impact on the accuracy but further improved the quantitative precision, independent of the instrument used (Supplementary Fig. 6). As a tradeoff, 18% (Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer) to 7% (Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer) fewer proteins were quantified for a 2:1 ratio mixture. We investigated the quantitative performance using larger fold changes of 5:1 and 10:1 in yeast quantity (Fig. 3d\u2013i), which showed similar results.\nWe additionally checked quantitation performance at the MS2 level, yielding a bit wider deviation around the expected fold change ratio than seen at the MS1 level (Supplementary Fig. 7).\nProof-of-principle studies using single cells\nHeterogeneity of two human non-small cell lung cancer models\nWe first benchmarked several previously reported sample preparation workflows to decide on an optimal strategy for our single-cell studies (Supplementary Information and Supplementary Fig. 8). We decided on the One-Pot workflow as it delivered optimal coverage and low background levels. We applied our optimal workflow conditions for sample preparation and data acquisition to single cells from lung cancer. The A549 and H460 cell lines are epithelial-like human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines commonly used for basic research and drug discovery. Although the same size range (20\u201330\u2009\u00b5m) of cells was selected for both cell types, their protein content seemed surprisingly different. Although we yielded 4,879 average PGs and 32,417 precursors for A549 cells, coverage for H460 cells was clearly lower at 3,166 average PGs and 17,619 precursors (Fig. 4a). In line with our previous results (Supplementary Fig. 8), blank controls showed only low background signals besides the abundant trypsin peaks. Linear dimensionality reduction through principal component analysis (PCA) and heat map analysis showed a clear separation of both cell lines and from the blank control runs based on their protein abundance profiles, proving the capability of the method to investigate cellular heterogeneity (Fig. 4b,c).\nSize: cell cycle dependency of A549 cells\nTo investigate our A549 model in more detail, three different size groups of cells ranging from 15\u201330\u2009\u00b5m in diameter were collected using the cellenONE robot. Sixty-six single A549 cells and three blanks were measured using the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer. As expected, the number of PGs identified correlated with the size of the cells (Fig. 4d) and ranged from 1,801 PGs for small cells to 2,870 PGs for large cells, on average, when searching library free and in method evaluation mode. When allowing for matching across single cells (DirectDIA+), ID numbers were improved to 3,304 (+83%) and 4,439 (+55%) for smaller and larger cells, respectively. These average ID numbers are very close to numbers we obtained for A549 cells in our first single-cell dataset (Fig. 4a), which was measured on a different Astral instrument and in a different lab, demonstrating the reproducibility of the workflow. We additionally investigated if the use of a spectral library might further increase ID numbers and created a tailored library either from 20 or 40 A549 cells isolated in a single well of a 384-well plate, processed and measured using the exact same settings as for single cells. We could not significantly improve proteome coverage using a library search instead of DirectDIA+, although the used 20- and 40-cell libraries contained much more protein than found in single cells (6,395 PGs for 20 cells and 6,762 PGs for 40 cells). Using the 40-cell library, ID numbers even dropped a bit (Fig. 4d). This is why we assume that there is a sweet spot in optimal library size. MS acquisition parameters, optimized for single-cell input, as accumulation time or m/z windows are likely not perfectly optimized anymore for larger amounts as used for a large library. In addition, we believe that the high number of replicates already serves as an excellent basis for matching. In line with those assumptions, we observed a more pronounced effect of using a library when optimizing the MS method for the higher input and when using fewer replicates of single cells, as done in our second study on TE-like cells and naive hPS cells (Fig. 5). In our hands, using a 20-cell library yielded the best results and enabled us to identify, on average, 3,351 PGs from small single A549 cells and 4,689 PGs from large single A549 cells. Maximum coverage was 5,300 proteins from a single A549 cell. We also examined the performance of DirectDIA+ with optimized settings, which yielded slightly more ID numbers than the method evaluation approach.\nWe investigated the technical characteristics of the dataset, data completeness and CV between single cells at the PG level. Data completeness dropped dramatically, with the number of files reaching only 1,053 of 5,805 PGs (~18%) identified in all 66 files (Supplementary Fig. 9a). There was also a slight dependence on cell size; for the 15- to 20-\u00b5m cell diameter range, we observed slightly lower data completeness across 19 files than in the two other groups (20\u201325\u2009\u00b5m and 25\u201330\u2009\u00b5m; Supplementary Fig. 9b\u2013d). As expected, mainly due to biological heterogeneity, the CV distributions for this dataset also looked completely different from HeLa or K562 cell peptide dilution series, where the CV was below 10%. The median CV distribution for single-cell runs was 65%, whereas for stock runs of 20 and 40 cells the median CV distributions were 17% and 16%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 9e\u2013g). This difference in CV aligns with our assumption that cells have a unique protein abundance distribution, which results in a high CV among single cells. In 20- and 40-cell samples, the CV was much lower because we averaged among 20 or 40 cells; however, it was not close to HeLa or K562 cell peptide dilution series. Several factors might be the issue: (1) 20 or 40 cells is not enough to average all biological differences between cells, and (2) for real datasets, sample lysis and digestion cause some fluctuations.\nWe next examined the extent of cellular heterogeneity of these cultured and untreated A549 cells by PCA and found that cells clustered differently dependent on their diameter (Fig. 4e). This is even more pronounced when performing a nonlinear uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP; Fig. 4f). We took a deeper look at the most abundant proteins identified in the single cells, which were histone H4 (H4C1) and the actins ACTB and ACTC1. Indeed, their abundance profiles were nicely reflected in the clustering seen in the PCA and UMAP (Extended Data Fig. 1). We suspect that their abundance differences might correlate with not only the recorded cell sizes but also the different cell cycle stages. G2/M phase cells are reported to be the largest, which is why we annotated our largest cell size cluster as presumably G2/M. Next, we tried to confirm this by checking the expression pattern of abundant and known marker proteins. Actins are known to play a crucial role in cell division and in the formation of cell junctions and maintenance of cell shape, which is highly relevant especially for cancer cells and therefore why it seems logical that their expression levels correlate to cell size and cell cycle stage. Histone levels are known to be elevated during G2/M phase when DNA synthesis occurs. To determine whether the cells with elevated H4C1 and H14 levels as determined by PCA and UMAP (Extended Data Fig. 1) could indeed be primarily in G2/M phase, we investigated the abundance levels of the nuclear ubiquitous casein and cyclin-dependent kinase substrate 1 (NUCKS1), which was also quantified in this dataset. NUCKS1 is known to be expressed at high levels in S phase and is indeed present at lower expression levels in those cells presumably in G2/M phase but is upregulated in another cell cluster (presumably in S phase). We also assessed the expression of the classical cell cycle marker CDK1. CDK1 was reported to have similar protein expression levels as NUCKS1 (ref. ), but we could not see a clear trend in the data. MKI67, another reporter protein expected to be maximally expressed in G2 phase, also showed results correlating to the size distribution (Extended Data Fig. 1).\nOf note, no cell cycle control was performed in this study, which is why our cellular population reflects a wild mix of all phases, impeding a clear separation but still allowing for the successful study of the heterogeneity of this system.\nCharacterization of human hPS cells and TE-like derivatives\nTo challenge our analytical LC\u2013MS/MS setup and the abilities of SCP further, we analyzed naive hPS cells and induced from them TE-like cells. On day 4, TE-like cells were collected and sorted for expression of the TROP2 marker protein using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We evaluated different analysis strategies (Fig. 5a). With our library-based approach, we could identify 2,339 and 2,544 PGs in TE-like and naive hPS cells, respectively. Data completeness at the PG level was 53% for hPS cells and 60% for TE-like cells across all files (Supplementary Fig. 10a,b). The CV distribution of PG abundances for TE-like and hPS single cells had a median of 44%, whereas 100-cell runs had abundances of 13% and 13%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 10c\u2013f).\nTo confirm that SCP can recapitulate known differences between naive hPS cells and TE-like cells, we performed PCA and UMAP clustering analysis on all cells in the dataset. We observed strong separation between these two cell populations (Fig. 5b,c) with both approaches, which aligned with cell type. PCA reported an explained variance of 51.8% (PC1) and 4.9% (PC2).\nGene Ontology (GO) analysis of proteins upregulated in TE-like cells showed enrichment in the following biological processes: cytoskeleton organization (GO:0007010), actin cytoskeleton organization (GO:0030036), epithelial cell differentiation (GO:0030855), epithelium development (GO:0060429), positive regulation of cell differentiation (GO:0045597) and cell differentiation (GO:0030154), which rightfully corresponds to the previously described biological processes underlying the differentiation of hPS cells into TE-like cells (Supplementary Fig. 11).\nTE cell analogs express the proteins GATA2, GATA3, CDX2 and TROP2 (ref. ). Transcription factors are typically of low abundance in the cell and are often challenging to detect with proteomics techniques. They are also partly localized in the nucleus, which can make them less accessible for extraction and analysis. Additionally, many transcription factors are modified by phosphorylation or other post-translational modifications that can affect their detection. Here, we were able to identify the proteins GATA2 and GATA3 at very low abundance in some TE-like cells. Among differentially expressed proteins between hPS cells and TE-like cells, we found many TE markers well known from transcriptome data: KRT18 (epithelium cytoskeleton), KRT19 (epithelium cytoskeleton), RAB25 (RAS pathway), DAB2 (ERK pathway), YAP1 (Hippo pathway), S100A16, SP6, CDH1, ENPEP, SLC7A2, HAVCR1 and PDLIM1, which are associated with TE development, and DPPA4, DPPA2, SUSD2 and DNMT3L, which are well-established naive hPS cell markers (Extended Data Fig. 2). Abundances for these proteins correlate with transcriptome data known from the literature.\nSingle-cell proteome data of naive hPS cells and TE-like cells demonstrate the capacity to distinguish primary cells and to extract meaningful biological information that complements and enriches results from transcriptome data.\nComparison with pseudobulk data (100 cells)\nWe compared the single-cell dataset of TE-like and hPS cells to pseudobulk data generated from 100-cell stocks. PCA distinguished different cell types with explained variances of 54.1% (PC1) and 15.5% (PC2; Supplementary Fig. 12a). We examined protein abundances of marker proteins, which were found for single-cell data. For all proteins but one, the trend was the same. ENPEP was found to be abundantly expressed in both TE-like and hPS cells in bulk data; however, at the single-cell level, it was found at high abundance only in TE-like cells.\nGO analysis of proteins upregulated in the TE-like bulk dataset showed much more biologically relevant pathways, even though the total number of upregulated proteins in pseudobulk data (from 100 cells) was lower than in single-cell data (415 versus 243 proteins). If we compare the same pathways that were identified in single-cell and bulk data (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 13), the number of proteins in enriched pathways was similar; however, the P values of the pathways for the pseudobulk data were lower. This is likely because of more intense, and hence more confident, signals and results in a much clearer picture originating from the bulk dataset than the noisier single-cell data. The intersection of upregulated proteins between bulk and single-cell data is 60 proteins.",
        "DISCUSS": "Discussion\nDespite tremendous improvements already made in the field of ultra-low-input proteomics by MS in the past decade, achieving a high sample throughput, reproducibility, quantitative accuracy, precision and high sensitivity at the same time is still very challenging. The presented workflow aims to fulfill those criteria by combining a high-performance zero-dead-end volume column at a short gradient with one of the most advanced, fast and sensitive MS instruments, FAIMS-based noise reduction and a DIA-based acquisition. The used packed bead column has a pulled emitter directly at the end of the column, which minimizes peak broadening and is further supported by the use of high flow rates during sample loading, increasing the throughput. LC flow rates are reduced during the active gradient to enhance sensitivity. We found that total throughputs of 50 SPD represent a sweet spot between maximizing speed of sample acquisition and maintaining enough measurement time to detect a median of five data points per elution peak, enabling proper quantification.\nHere, we assess quantitative accuracy and precision at the single-cell level using a two-proteome mix. At five data points per elution peak as reached on the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer at 50 SPD, successful separation of twofold changes in protein abundance and quantification of as little material as 10\u2009pg in the most extreme case still worked. However, the CV of quantified proteins within a sample increased with decreased protein abundance. Hence, relative abundance within a single-cell sample is an important consideration for future biological studies as the confident clustering of cellular populations can currently only rely on more abundant proteins within single cells. Despite this limitation, the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer clearly outperforms the Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer in terms of number of quantified proteins, sensitivity and quantitative accuracy, allowing for the investigation of heterogeneity of untreated cultured cells based on their size and cell cycle phase, as shown for A549 cells. Furthermore, the distinct separation we observed between TE-like cells and naive hPS cells highlights the potential of this SCP workflow for application to human blastocysts. It could clearly aid in exploring TE development mechanisms, blastocyst morphology regulation and the identification of molecular markers of high-quality blastocysts. Ultimately, this knowledge could contribute to our understanding of human blastocyst development and also potentially improve in vitro fertilization success rates.\nIn conclusion, we are convinced that our comprehensive workflow with optimized and improved parameters from sample preparation to data interpretation is a highly valuable contribution to evolve SCP to the next level in terms of sensitivity, reproducibility and quantitative performance, helping to transition the field of SCP from the developmental phase to a technique for the biologist\u2019s toolbox.",

Briefly, cells were sorted into wells containing 1\u2009\u00b5l of master mix (0.2% DDM (D4641-500MG, Sigma-Aldrich), 100\u2009mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB; 17902-500ML, Fluka Analytical), 3\u2009ng\u2009\u00b5l\u20131 trypsin (Trypsin Gold, V5280, Promega), 0.01% enhancer (ProteaseMAX, V2071, Promega) and 1% DMSO). For single-cell samples, cells were deposited into individual wells, whereas for 20- or 40-cell libraries, the respective cell number was sorted into a single well. Humidity and temperature were controlled at 50% and 15\u2009\u00b0C during cell sorting. A549 and H460 cells were isolated at a given diameter of 15\u201330\u2009\u00b5m and HeLa cells at 18\u201325\u2009\u03bcm. The maximum elongation was set to 1.5. Cell lysis and protein digestion were performed at 50\u2009\u00b0C and 85% relative humidity for 30\u2009min before an additional 500\u2009nl of 3\u2009ng\u2009\u03bcl\u20131 trypsin was added. After lysis and digestion, 3.5\u2009\u03bcl of 0.1% TFA was added to the respective wells for quenching and storage at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C. For LC\u2013MS/MS analysis, samples were directly injected from the 384-well plate.\nFor benchmarking studies to proteoCHIP-based sample preparation, cells were isolated and prepared exactly as described in the manufacturer\u2019s manual. Standard (nonstringent) washing of chips was performed by sonication in methanol for 20\u2009min, followed by extensive flushing with Milli-Q water and drying in the fume hood. A stringent washing protocol was established by Cellenion and is considered proprietary. In brief, 300\u2009nl of master mix (0.2% DDM, 10\u2009ng\u2009\u00b5l\u20131 Trypsin Gold and 100\u2009mM TEAB) was dispensed into each well of a LF48 proteoCHIP or an EVO 96 proteoCHIP (Cellenion) using the cellenONE robot. The LF48 chip was prefilled with 2\u2009\u00b5l of hexadecane oil (H6703-100ML, Sigma-Aldrich) per well. ProteoCHIPs were cooled to 8\u2009\u00b0C for cell isolation, which freezes the hexadecane (LF48). Cells were isolated as described above following stepwise heating to a final temperature of 50\u2009\u00b0C at 85% relative humidity for lysis and digestion. Constant addition of water by the cellenONE robot kept the samples hydrated and at the approximate constant volume. After that, 3.5\u2009\u00b5l of 0.1% TFA was added, and the proteoCHIP LF48 was cooled on wet ice to refreeze the hexadecane and manually separated from the sample containing the aqueous phase by transferring the sample to individual wells of a low-binding 96-well PCR plate (EP0030129512, Twin.tec PCR Plate 96 LoBind, skirted). The EVO 96 proteoCHIP did not contain hexadecane and was directly placed on top of a 96-well PCR plate to transfer the sample by centrifugation (500g, 30\u2009s).\nNaive hPS cell culturing\nNaive PS cells were cultured on gelatin-coated plates with a feeder layer of gamma-irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The coating and feeder layer preparation methods were as previously described. Cells were cultured in PXGL medium composed of N2B27 basal medium supplemented with 1\u2009\u00b5M PD0325901 (MedChemExpress, HY-10254), 1\u2009\u00b5M XAV-939 (MedChemExpress, HY-15147), 2\u2009\u00b5M G\u00f6 6983 (MedChemExpress, HY-13689) and 10\u2009ng\u2009ml\u20131 human leukemia inhibitory factor (made in-house). Formulation of the N2B27 basal medium included 50% DMEM/F12, 50% neurobasal medium, N-2 and B-27 supplements, GlutaMAX supplement, nonessential amino acids and 100\u2009\u00b5M 2-mercaptoethanol. Cells were maintained in a hypoxic chamber (5% CO2, 5% O2) and passaged every 3\u20134\u2009days. All cell lines were routinely tested negative for mycoplasma.\nTE differentiation from naive hPS cells\nNaive PS cells were dissociated using Accutase (Biozym, B423201) at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min. Gentle mechanical dissociation was performed using a pipette, followed by centrifugation to collect the cell pellet. The pellet was resuspended in PXGL medium supplemented with 10\u2009\u00b5M Y-27632 (MedChemExpress, HY-10583). To exclude MEFs, the cell suspension was transferred onto gelatin-coated plates and incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 70\u2009min. Cell counting and viability were determined using a Countess automated cell counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with trypan blue staining. Cells were seeded at a density of 1.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells per well on Geltrex (0.5\u2009\u00b5l\u2009cm\u20132)-coated six-well plates. Culturing was performed in a hypoxic chamber (5% CO2, 5% O2). On induction day 0, the medium was replaced with PDA83 medium comprising N2B27 basal medium, 1\u2009\u00b5M PD0325901, 1\u2009\u00b5M A83-01 (MedChemExpress, HY-10432) and 2% FBS. On day 1, 2\u2009\u00b5M XMU-MP-1 was added. On days 2 and 3, the medium was switched to N2B27 with 2% FBS. On day 4, FACS was conducted using the following protocol.\nTE and hPS cell FACS sorting and sample preparation\nTE-like cells and naive PS cells were dissociated using Accutase (B423201, Biozym) at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min and 5\u2009min, respectively. Gentle mechanical dissociation was performed using a pipette. Cells were then stained with antibodies to TROP2 and SUSD2, respectively. For sorting TE-like cells, TROP2+ cells were selected, ensuring exclusion of nondifferentiated cells. Similarly, for naive hPS cell sorting, SUSD2+ cells were sorted into six-well plates to exclude MEFs. Under both conditions, dead cells were identified and excluded using DAPI staining. The FACS gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15 for TE and hPS cells. Cells were sorted into 384-well plates (Thermo Scientific Armadillo 45PCR Plate, 384 well, 12657516), which already contained 1\u2009\u03bcl of lysis buffer (100\u2009mM TEAB (17902-500ML, Fluka Analytical), 0.2% DDM (D4641-500MG, Sigma-Aldrich), 3\u2009ng\u2009\u00b5l\u20131 trypsin (Trypsin Gold, V5280, Promega) and 0.01% enhancer (ProteaseMAX, V2071, Promega)) in each well. After sorting, well plates were moved to humidity- and temperature-controlled cellenONE chambers. Samples were incubated for 30\u2009min at a humidity of 85% and a temperature of 50\u2009\u00b0C. An additional 500\u2009nl of 3\u2009ng\u2009\u03bcl\u20131 trypsin was added. Constant addition of water by the cellenONE robot kept the samples hydrated and at the approximate constant volume. After lysis and digestion, 3.5\u2009\u03bcl of 0.1% TFA and 5% DMSO was added to the respective wells for quenching and storage at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C. For LC\u2013MS/MS analysis, samples were directly injected from the 384-well plate.\nTwo-proteome mixes\nHeLa (Thermo Scientific, Pierce HeLa Protein Digest Standard, 88328) and yeast (Promega, MS Compatible Yeast Protein Extract, Digest, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 100\u2009\u00b5g, V7461) were combined in 0.1% TFA at the following ratios and at a concentration of 250\u2009pg\u2009\u00b5l\u20131: HeLa:yeast\u2009=\u2009200\u2009pg:50\u2009pg, 240\u2009pg:10\u2009pg and 150\u2009pg:100\u2009pg. One microliter (250\u2009pg) of each two-proteome mix was injected to assess the limits of quantification at ultra-low-input levels.\nDiluted bulk digests\nHeLa (Thermo Scientific, Pierce HeLa Protein Digest Standard, 88328) or K562 (Promega, Mass Spec-Compatible Human Protein Extract, V6951) cell peptides were dissolved in 0.1% TFA and 0.015% DDM (D4641-500MG, Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 5\u2009ng\u2009\u00b5l\u20131 for injection into the LC\u2013MS system.\nLC\u2013MS analysis\nSamples were analyzed using the Thermo Scientific Vanquish Neo UHPLC system. Thermo Tune software version 0.4 or higher was used to acquire data.\nPeptides were separated on an Aurora Ultimate TS 25-cm nanoflow UHPLC column with an integrated emitter (Ion Optics) at 50\u2009\u00b0C using direct injection mode.\nPeptide separation was performed at 30\u201380 SPD with details provided in Supplementary Table 1 and with all single-cell measurements performed at 50 SPD. Fast sample loading was performed at a maximum pressure of 1.4\u2009\u00d7\u2009108\u2009Pa and at a maximum flow rate of 1\u2009\u00b5l\u2009min\u20131.\nFor MS measuring, the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer and the Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (both Thermo Scientific) were coupled to the LC. Both instruments were equipped with a FAIMS Pro interface (Thermo Scientific) and an EASY-Spray source. Data recorded for reproducibility checks (Supplementary Fig. 1d) were recorded on a second Orbitrap Astral instrument equipped with a FAIMS Pro Duo interface. A compensation voltage of \u201348\u2009V (Orbitrap Astral) or \u201350\u2009V (Orbitrap Exploris 480) was used, if not indicated differently. An electrospray voltage of 1.85\u2009kV was applied for ionization and adopted to slightly higher voltages for aged emitters to ensure spray stability.\nOn the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer, MS1 spectra were recorded using the Orbitrap analyzer at a resolution of 240,000 from m/z 400 to 900 using an automated gate control (AGC) target of 500% and a maximum injection time of 100\u2009ms. For MS2 in DIA mode using the Astral analyzer, nonoverlapping isolation windows ranging from an m/z of 5 for 100 cells and 5- to 10-ng bulks to an m/z of 8 for 5-ng bulks to an m/z of 10 for 700-pg to 1-ng bulks and to an m/z of 20 for 1\u201340 cells, blanks and 50- to 500-pg bulks. A scan range from an m/z of 400 to 800 was chosen. The precursor accumulation time ranged from 10\u2009ms for 100 cells and 5- to 10-ng bulks to 14\u2009ms for 700-pg to 1-ng bulks to 40\u2009ms for 250- to 500-pg bulks to 60\u2009ms for 100- to 150-pg bulks, 1\u201340 cells and blanks and to a maximum of 80\u2009ms for 50-pg bulks. The AGC target was set to 800%.\nOn the Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer, the MS method was altered due to the lower speed and sensitivity of that instrument than the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer. However, comparable settings for high-throughput analysis as tested previously were used with the following details: MS1 spectra were recorded using the Orbitrap analyzer at a resolution of 120,000 from an m/z of 400 to 800 using an AGC target of 300%. For MS2 in DIA mode, overlapping (m/z of 1) isolation windows of an m/z of 40 and a scan range from an m/z of 400 to 800 were chosen. The precursor accumulation time was set to a maximum of 118\u2009ms, and the AGC target was set to 1,000%.\nData analysis\nAll raw data were analyzed using Spectronaut (version 18.6.231227.55695, Biognosys). For results marked as \u2018method evaluation\u2019, DirectDIA+ was used in method evaluation mode without cross-normalization and with every raw file defined as a separate condition to ensure that Spectronaut treats each file as if they were analyzed individually. \u2018DirectDIA+\u2019 indicates that results were analyzed in DirectDIA+ mode with replicates defined as the same condition in the search settings. For library searches, higher-input DIA recorded results (as given) were first analyzed in DirectDIA+ mode, and a library was created from those files using Spectronaut. Quantification was performed at the MS1 level. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines as a static modification was removed for single-cell searches as no alkylation step was performed. Factory settings were used for all analyses and for library generation unless otherwise indicated. \u2018Optimized settings\u2019 indicates that searches were performed with a more stringent cutoff value of 0.01 (for precursor q-value cutoff, precursor posterior error probability (PEP) cutoff, protein q-value cutoff (experiment/run) and protein PEP cutoff) as described by Baker et al.. Searches were performed against the human proteome (UniProt proteome UP000005640, reviewed, 20,408 protein entries, downloaded 4 August 2023) and the CRAPome (118 protein entries). Searches for the two-proteome analysis were run against the same human database and the yeast proteome (UniProt proteome UP000002311, reviewed, 6,727 protein entries, downloaded 11 December 2023).\nIf not otherwise stated, FDR filtering was based on default settings of Spectronaut and at 1% at the protein level. For FDR checks, a decoy (\u2018shuffled target\u2019) database was generated using the pyteomics Python package in shuffled mode with fixed positions for arginine, proline and lysine to make sure that peptide mass and length distributions were the same as in a target database. A C. elegans (UniProtKB, downloaded 13 June 2024, 27,084 entities) database was also used as an entrapment database. The FDR was estimated using the following equation:where d is the number of decoy proteins, t represents target proteins, and r represents the ratio between decoy and target databases.\nPostanalysis\nHuman and yeast dataset\nRaw quantity values were used. All proteins with missing quantitative values were filtered out.\nSingle-cell datasets\nFor the statistical analysis of single-cell data, DirectDIA+ results were used. All proteins with missing values in more than 20 cells for A459 cells and 5 cells for the TE with hPS cell dataset were filtered out. For H460 and A549 cells (and blank files), dataset proteins with 20 or more missing values were filtered out. The rest of the missing values were substituted with intensities equal to the minimum in the dataset. Quantitative data were then transformed to log2 format and normalized to normal distribution. The cell diameter data for PCA and UMAP clustering were taken from the cellenONE robot. PCA and UMAP clustering were performed using sklearn (version 1.2.0) and umap (version 0.5.6) Python packages. Cluster mapping of A549 and H460 cells and blanks was performed using the seaborn (0.12.2) Python package.\nTo find statistical differences between hPS cells and TE cells, a Student\u2019s t-test for two independent samples was performed (scipy (version 1.11.4) Python package). The Benjamini\u2013Hochberg FDR was used to correct P values for multiple comparisons (statsmodel (v. 0.14.1) Python package). The level of significance for corrected P values was set to 0.05. Proteins with fold change values (TE/hPS cells) greater than 1 were considered upregulated. GO analysis of upregulated proteins was performed using String-db.org (version 12.0).\nPseudobulk dataset of TE-like and hPS cells\nAs a \u2018bulk\u2019 dataset, we considered 100-cell runs, both TE-like and hPS cells analyzed together (six runs in total). We filtered out all proteins that were missing in three or more runs. The missing values were substituted with intensities equal to the minimum in the dataset. Quantitative data were then transformed to log2 format and normalized to normal distribution. GO analysis of bulk data was performed the same way as for single-cell data.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nOnline content\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code availability are available at 10.1038/s41592-024-02559-1.",
