    "ABSTRACT": "Integrins are heterodimeric glycoproteins that bind cells to extracellular matrix. Upon integrin clustering, multimolecular integrin adhesion complexes (IACs) are formed, creating links to the cell cytoskeleton. We have previously observed decreased cell migration and increased sensitivity to microtubule (MT) poisons, paclitaxel and vincristine, in the melanoma cell line MDA-MB-435S upon transfection with integrin \u03b1V-specific siRNA, suggesting a link between adhesion and drug sensitivity. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we determined \u03b1V-dependent changes in IAC composition. Using mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, we analyzed the components of isolated IACs of MDA-MB-435S cells and two MDA-MB-435S-derived integrin \u03b1V-specific shRNA-expressing cell clones with decreased expression of integrin \u03b1V. MS analysis showed that cells preferentially use integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 for the formation of IACs. The differential analysis between MDA-MB-435S cells and clones with decreased expression of integrin \u03b1V identified key components of integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 adhesion complexes as talins 1 and 2, \u03b1-actinins 1 and 4, filamins A and B, plectin and vinculin. The data also revealed decreased levels of several components of the cortical microtubule stabilization complex, which recruits MTs to adhesion sites (notably liprins \u03b1 and \u03b2, ELKS, LL5\u03b2, MACF1, KANK1, and KANK2), following \u03b1V knockdown. KANK2 knockdown in MDA-MB-435S cells mimicked the effect of integrin \u03b1V knockdown and resulted in increased sensitivity to MT poisons and decreased migration. Taken together, we conclude that KANK2 is a key molecule linking integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 IACs to MTs, and enabling the actin-MT crosstalk that is important for both sensitivity to MT poisons and cell migration.",
    "INTRO": "Introduction\nIntegrins are cell-surface adhesion molecules that connect cells to other cells and components of the ECM. Integrins are heterodimers composed of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. A set of 18 \u03b1 and 8 \u03b2 subunits that associate to form 24 different \u03b1\u03b2 heterodimers have thus far been identified. Integrins are involved in signaling pathways that regulate many essential cellular functions including survival, proliferation and migration. Upon clustering of integrins, other proteins are recruited to their cytoplasmic tails to form multimolecular IACs which establish the linkage between integrins and the cell cytoskeleton. Integrins together with their associated IAC components have been termed the adhesome. The fate of such a complex depends on cell type, composition of ECM, matrix stiffness, integrin subtype, etc. ultimately leading to formation of a variety of IAC-induced structures including nascent adhesions, FAs, fibrillar adhesions, podosomes and invadopodia. Novel adhesive structures termed reticular adhesions (RAs) were identified in 2018, which are rich in integrin \u03b1v\u03b25 but devoid of most of the typical cytoskeletal components found in other IACs, and, instead, are connected to the clathrin machinery. The association between integrins and F-actin occurs through proteins such as talin and vinculin. Talin also coordinates the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton at adhesion sites through the interaction with KN motif and ankyrin repeat domain-containing (KANK) proteins, which stimulates FA turnover.\nSeveral protocols have been developed to purify ventral IACs from 2D cell cultures. A variety of cell types have been investigated using these methods. However, most IAC preparations have been isolated from cells seeded on fibronectin. Seven of these datasets have been analyzed together which led to the definition of a fibronectin-induced \u201cmeta adhesome\u201d composed of over 2400 proteins. The meta adhesome was further reduced to 60 core proteins, termed as the \u201cconsensus adhesome\u201d i.e., proteins that are most frequently identified in IACs. The consensus adhesome was obtained from cells seeded on fibronectin, and therefore its composition reflects components of integrin heterodimers \u03b15\u03b21 and \u03b1V\u03b23. It was also shown to be centered around potential axes that link integrins to actin, namely ILK-PINCH-parvin-kindlin, FAK-paxillin, talin-vinculin and \u03b1-actinin-zyxin-VASP axis.\nThe repertoire of integrins in tumor cells and the composition of ECM, deposited by tumor and stromal cells, both contribute to integrin signaling in promoting invasive growth and metastasis. Integrin signaling confers resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Conversely, knockdown of integrins may sensitize tumor cells to both chemo- and radiotherapy. Therefore, integrins are promising targets to be combined with classical therapy, especially \u03b1V integrins which play non-essential roles in development but are involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis. The integrin \u03b1V subunit is known to form heterodimers with one of five different \u03b2 subunits (\u03b21, \u03b23, \u03b25, \u03b26, and \u03b28). Among these integrins, \u03b1V\u03b23 and \u03b1V\u03b25 have been extensively studied. Integrin \u03b1V\u03b23, highly expressed in melanoma, has a pivotal role in melanoma growth, initiates the transition from the benign radial growth phase to the malignant vertical growth phase, and its expression is increased in brain metastases compared to primary melanoma. The importance of integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 was also demonstrated in melanoma, showing its involvement in the highly aggressive phenotype of melanoma cells expressing neuropilin 1. Integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 has been shown to trigger formation of FAs. Moreover, it has been recently shown that integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 is the predominant integrin used by cells in long term culture, not only in FAs but also in RAs. RAs are morphologically and dynamically distinct from classical FAs, formed during interphase and preserved at cell-ECM attachment sites throughout cell division.\nUsing the melanoma cell line MDA-MB-435S, which expresses only integrins \u03b23 and \u03b25 as \u03b1V integrins binding partners, we showed that \u03b1V knockdown increases sensitivity to antitumor drugs that target MTs, paclitaxel (PTX) and vincristine (VCR). We also identified integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 as a key integrin in this process. Concomitantly, we demonstrated that integrin \u03b1V knockdown decreases migration and invasion, a process in which both integrins \u03b1V\u03b23 and \u03b1V\u03b25 are involved. Here, we aimed to identify the integrin(s) used by MDA-MB-435S cells in cell culture and to catalog changes in IAC composition upon integrin \u03b1V knockdown. We report that integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 is the predominant integrin used by MDA-MB-435S cells in long term culture and reveal the composition of integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 adhesion complexes. We show that one of the identified components is KANK2, whose knockdown in MDA-MB-435S cells mimics increased sensitivity to MT poisons and decreased migration upon integrin \u03b1V knockdown. Therefore, KANK2 is crucial for the functional connection of integrin \u03b1V\u03b25-containing FAs with MTs and represents a potential target for improvement of melanoma therapy.",
    "RESULTS": "Results\nMDA-MB-435S Clones With Stable Knockdown of Integrin \u03b1V Subunit Display Increased Sensitivity to Microtubule Poisons and Decreased Cell Migration\nWe have recently shown that knockdown of integrin subunit \u03b1V, via transient transfection of integrin \u03b1V-specific siRNA, increased sensitivity of MDA-MB-435S cells to PTX and VCR and decreased migration. In a series of experiments, the effect on sensitivity to MT poisons was ascribed to integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 but not to integrin \u03b1V\u03b23. On the other hand, both \u03b1V integrins, \u03b1V\u03b23 and \u03b1V\u03b25, were implicated in the regulation of cell migration. In the present work, our aim was to unravel a possible link between these alterations in sensitivity to MT poisons and migration and the adhesome composition. When \u03b25 was knocked down, we observed upregulation of integrin \u03b1V\u03b23, and vice versa. We named this phenomenon the integrin balance effect. For this reason, we cataloged the adhesome of MDA-MB-435S cells and compared it to the adhesome of cells upon integrin \u03b1V knockdown. We isolated two MDA-MB-435S clones stably transfected with a plasmid expressing shRNA specific for integrin \u03b1V: clones 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V. The surface expression of integrin subunit \u03b1V and integrin heterodimers \u03b1V\u03b23 and \u03b1V\u03b25 in both clones was substantially decreased, as measured by flow cytometry. Additionally, we observed slightly lower expression of these integrins in 3\u03b1V compared to 2\u03b1V. Since the MDA-MB-435S cell line does not express integrin \u03b1V\u03b21, the knockdown of integrin \u03b1V did not affect the expression of integrin \u03b21 heterodimers (Figure 1). Both clones showed increased sensitivity to PTX and VCR and decreased sensitivity to cDDP (Figure 2A), which is in line with our previous results using transient transfection of integrin \u03b1V- or \u03b25-specific siRNA. In addition, 72 h after PTX treatment a greater number of apoptotic cells was found in the cultures of both clones 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V as compared to parental MDA-MB-435S cells (30 and 32% compared to 17%, respectively) (Figure 2B). Decreased expression of integrins \u03b1V\u03b23 and \u03b1V\u03b25 in clones 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V did not affect cell proliferation (Figure 2C). However, when cells were cultivated for 72 h, starting with the same number of plated cells, we observed decreased number of 2\u03b1V cells and particularly 3\u03b1V cells, showing a dose response relationship with integrin \u03b1V knockdown (Figure 2D). In addition, when culturing cells for 48 h to perform IF staining (Figure 3), we observed that clones 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V were smaller than MDA-MB-435S cells. We assumed that delayed adhesion to ECM proteins, due to integrin \u03b1V knockdown, was the main reason for this effect. In order to test this hypothesis, we visualized cell attachment and spreading using live cell microscopy for 12 h following plating (Figure 2E), monitored cell spreading within 72 h of growth (Supplementary Figure S1A), and analyzed cell surface area (Supplementary Figure S1B), size and granularity of cells in suspension using flow cytometry (Supplementary Figure S1C). Results showed that although all cells have similar initial rounded sizes in suspension, clones 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V have significantly impaired attachment and spreading when plated on culture dishes compared to parental cells. Finally, decreased migration of both clones compared to MDA-MB-435S cells was observed (Figure 2F), which is also in line with our previous results following transient transfection with integrin \u03b1V-specific siRNA. The degree of inhibition of migration correlated with the extent of integrin \u03b1V knockdown (Figures 1, 2F).\nOur recently published data have shown that upon transient knockdown of integrin subunit \u03b1V in MDA-MB-435S, the cells showed disorganization of actin with loss of stress fibers and significant loss of paxillin staining at the tips of stress fibers, indicating a reduction in the number of FAs. We therefore tested whether clones 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V show similar features. IF staining of MDA-MB-435S cells confirmed the formation of well-defined adhesion structures containing integrin \u03b1V and paxillin while in clones 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V their number was reduced (Figure 3A). Furthermore, both clones had a decreased number of FAs per cell analyzed by counting either integrin \u03b1V- or paxillin-positive puncta, as well as a decreased amount of actin stress fibers per cell (Figure 3B). In conclusion, the model of MDA-MB-435S-derived stably transfected clones 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V fully mimics the effects of transient transfection with integrin \u03b1V-specific siRNA.\nMelanoma Cell Line MDA-MB-435S Primarily Utilizes Integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 for Adhesion\nTo better understand the observed changes in cell migration and sensitivity to microtubule poisons, PTX and VCR, the adhesome of MDA-MB-435S and clones 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V was analyzed. Since cytotoxicity assays (Figures 2A,B), as well as IF analysis (Figure 3), were performed in cell culture without prior coating with ECM proteins, we analyzed IACs in the same manner. This approach also enabled cell-secreted ECM proteins to be analyzed. We performed MS analysis of isolated IACs from MDA-MB-435S cells and clones 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V following 48 h of growth. IACs were isolated as previously described. The duration of crosslinking (see section \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d) was chosen based on the WB analysis of isolated IACs using antibodies against well-defined adhesion complex components, such as paxillin and non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src [pSrc (Y418)] (data not shown). IACs were then isolated from MDA-MB-435S and clones 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V and the isolation procedure performed in triplicate for MDA-MB-435S and 3\u03b1V and in duplicate for 2\u03b1V. Samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and spectral counts used as a measure of protein abundance. These analyses detected 153 proteins with at least 99% confidence from IACs isolated from MDA-MB-435S cells (Supplementary Table S2.1), including 120 proteins that were termed as meta-adhesome proteins. Label-free quantification demonstrated good reproducibility between data either from technical or biological replicates.\nTo provide an overall view of both components of the isolated IACs in MDA-MB-435S cells and of components of the ECM, a protein\u2013protein interaction network was constructed (Figure 4A and Supplementary Table S2.2). The most surprising finding was that the only integrin receptor subunits identified in MDA-MB-435S cells were \u03b1V and \u03b25, indicating that these cells primarily utilize integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 for adhesion in long term 2D culture (48 h). The majority of identified proteins were actin-binding and ECM proteins. We also identified proteins reported to bind MT and intermediate filaments, several GTPases and kinases, together with components of the CMSC.\nTo further analyze the dataset, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed on proteins identified in IACs isolated from MDA-MB-435S cells, using the online bioinformatics tools available via the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID1), and GO terms were visualized using REViGO tool. Analysis confirmed a significant enrichment of GO terms related to ECM, extracellular exosome, FA and actin cytoskeleton (Figure 4B and Supplementary Table S2.3).\nIntegrin \u03b1V\u03b25-Induced Interaction Networks\nA volcano plot was constructed displaying proteins whose abundance was different in clones 2\u03b1V (red dots) or 3\u03b1V (black dots) compared to parental cells (Figure 4C). The differences observed in clones 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V, compared to MDA-MB-435S cells, were summarized using a Venn diagram (Figure 4D). As expected, both clones showed reduced levels of integrins \u03b1V and \u03b25 compared to control cells. IAC proteins detected at lower levels in clones 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V are in the category of proteins detected by high number of spectra (Supplementary Table S2), and they belong mostly to the actin binding subgroup of the adhesome: plectin, talin 1 and 2, filamin A and B, \u03b1-actinin 1 and 4, and vinculin. Additionally, lower levels of three adhesome proteins, liprin \u03b21, AHNAK and tensin 3, were found only in clone 3\u03b1V. We also observed higher levels of 17 proteins upon integrin \u03b1V knockdown in either 2\u03b1V (5), 3\u03b1V (14), or both (2) (Figure 4D), all belonging to the group of proteins identified by lower number of spectra (Supplementary Table S2.4). DAVID GO analysis of IAC proteins with lower abundance in clones 2\u03b1V or 3\u03b1V, compared to MDA-MB-435S cells, suggested that they are mostly components of FAs. Conversely, proteins present in higher levels in clones 2\u03b1V or 3\u03b1V as compared to MDA-MB-435S cells were classified as ECM or extracellular exosome proteins (Figure 4E and Supplementary Table S2.4).\nWe compared our adhesome protein dataset with those previously reported in the literature. However, it should be noted that this adhesome dataset differed in that it was not obtained from cells seeded on fibronectin, but upon cultivation of cells for 48 h without prior coating with any ECM component. Therefore, it was not surprising that, unlike other reported adhesomes, we detected many ECM proteins secreted by the cells themselves. More specifically, from 153 proteins that we identified in our adhesome, 120 were reported in earlier studies (Supplementary Table S2.1). DAVID GO analysis of the remaining 33 proteins showed that they were mostly related with extracellular proteins (exosome and ECM proteins; Supplementary Table S2.5). In addition, we investigated whether any proteins were differentially expressed in our cell model which might indicate that they are specific for either the integrin \u03b1V adhesome or matrisome. We identified only one, i.e., Hyaluronan Binding Protein 2 (HABP2) for which the increased abundance had been observed in cell clones with decreased expression of integrin \u03b1V. Interestingly, we have observed the increased abundance of HABP2 in another melanoma cell line RPMI-7951 cell model upon transient knockdown of integrin \u03b1V (data not shown, manuscript in preparation). HABP2 is the extracellular serine protease which play a role in non-small lung cancer progression but its role in melanoma is unknown.\nNext we validated data from MS using IF and WB. We selected two proteins in clone 2\u03b1V with the largest decrease, vinculin and talin, and one protein with a low but still significant decrease, \u03b1-actinin 1 (Supplementary Table S2). IF analysis showed a lower number of FAs per cell according to vinculin or talin 1/2 labeling, as well as a reduced area of \u03b1-actinin 1 labeling in both clones compared to MDA-MB-435S cells (Figures 5A,B). Of note, although they were not identified by MS, we analyzed the expression of pFAK (Y397) and pSrc (Y418) using IF and found changes in their expression, which is in line with the decreased number of FAs (Supplementary Figure S2). Finally, WB was performed on IAC isolates, which confirmed decreased levels of filamin A, talin 1/2, vinculin, \u03b1-actinin 1, \u03b1-actinin 4, liprin \u03b21, and FA marker protein paxillin (Figure 5C and Supplementary Figure S5).\nIntegrin \u03b1V\u03b25 Adhesion Complexes Are Composed of Focal and Reticular Adhesions\nOur results have shown that integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 is the preferential integrin used in cell culture by melanoma cell line MDA-MB-435S (Figure 4). Stable knockdown of integrin \u03b1V in clones 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V decreased the number of integrin \u03b1V and \u03b25 peptides detected by MS (Figure 6A), which correlated with the results of measurement of integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 surface expression by flow cytometry (Figure 1). We have also quantified the number of FAs per cell according to integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 heterodimer-specific antibody staining (Figures 6B,C) and observed a similar dose-response relationship as already observed for integrin \u03b1V and paxillin (Figures 3A,B) or talin 1/2 or vinculin (Figures 5A,B). Interestingly, IF analysis has shown that integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 in MDA-MB-435S was also localized further from the cell periphery, forming ring-like or reticular structures, but without recruiting vinculin (Figure 6D, left panel). These structures resembled recently described RAs shown to maintain cell\u2013ECM attachment during mitotic rounding and division. The FAs and RAs were shown to colocalize with dark areas in IRM, indicating their presence at the cell-substrate adhesion sites. Reticular adhesions were also present in cell clone 2\u03b1V and also colocalized with dark IRM areas (Figure 6D, right panel). observed a range of defects in \u03b25 depleted cells, including the failure of cytokinesis which resulted in binucleate daughter cells. Indeed, in MDA-MB-435S cells upon integrin \u03b1V knockdown we observed more multinucleated cells (Supplementary Figure S3).\nKANK2 Is a Potential Key Target for Increasing Sensitivity to Microtubule Poisons and Decreasing Migration\nA recent report demonstrated the existence of CMSC in the vicinity of mature FAs that capture MTs, containing CLASPs, kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A), LL5\u03b2 [also known as pleckstrin homology (PH)\u2013like domain, family B, member 2 (PHLDB2)], liprin \u03b11 and \u03b21, as well as paralogs of KANK. They showed that the CMSC is recruited to FAs by KANK1, which directly interacts with the major FA component, talin. On the other hand, KANK2 was also found adjacent to FAs in regions enriched in liprin \u03b21 and ELKS (known as ERC1 for ELKS/RAB6-interacting/CAST family member 1), and was shown to bind talin directly to MTs.\nAs described above, in one of the clones (3\u03b1V), we observed a reduced abundance of liprin \u03b21 in IACs (Figure 4D), which is a key component of CMSC. However, assessment of MS data (Supplementary Table S2.1, marked as YES in CMSC column) showed that liprin \u03b21, although not statistically significant, was also present at a lower abundance in cell clone 2\u03b1V. The reduced abundance of liprin \u03b21 was confirmed in both clones using WB analysis (Figure 5C). Further inspection of the MS data identified several other CMSC proteins in MDA-MB-435S and clones 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V, although represented at a lower abundance. These were liprin \u03b11, ELKS, LL5\u03b2, MT-actin cross-linking factor 1 (MACF1), and KANK1 and 2 (Supplementary Table S2.1, marked as YES in CMSC column). Since KANK proteins recently emerged as key regulators of adhesion dynamics, we selected KANK2 for further investigation. We observed lower number of average spectra for KANK2 in clones 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V compared to MDA-MB-435S cells (Figure 7A), and confirmed lower expression by WB in samples of isolated IACs (Figure 7B and Supplementary Figure S6).\nIn order to analyze the role of KANK2 in sensitivity to MT poisons, we measured sensitivity to PTX and VCR upon transient transfection of MDA-MB-435S cells with control vs. KANK2-specific siRNA. Knockdown of KANK2 in MDA-MB-435S cells was successful (Figure 7C and Supplementary Figure S6), and resulted in increased sensitivity to VCR and PTX (Figure 7D). Finally, we demonstrated that migration of MDA-MB-435S cells transfected transiently with KANK2-specific siRNA was reduced in comparison to cells transfected with control siRNA (Figure 7E). We conclude that KANK2 is a potential target IAC protein for increasing sensitivity to MT poisons and decreasing migration.\nCrosstalk between actin and MT dynamics is mediated through a number of proteins. Among them is the KANK family of proteins, which play important roles in regulating MT dynamics around FAs. KANK2, MTs and the actin cytoskeleton were therefore visualized in MDA-MB-435S cells with and without KANK2 knockdown. Simultaneously, IRM was used to visualize FAs. In control cells, we found KANK2 at the tips of MT fibers that overlapped with FAs. Although the cell size did not change upon KANK2 knockdown, the MTs did appear more condensed. Visualization of actin upon KANK2 knockdown showed that the amount of stress fibers did not change (Figure 7F).\nFinally, to test whether KANK2 is predominantly linked to integrin \u03b1V\u03b25, we analyzed KANK2 localization upon integrin \u03b25 knockdown (Supplementary Figure S4A). Results showed strongly reduced levels of KANK2-positive puncta, reduced amount of stress fibers and reduced cell size (Supplementary Figures S4B,C). We conclude that KANK2 is a key molecule linking integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 FAs to MTs, thus enabling actin-MT crosstalk that is important for both sensitivity to MT poisons and cell migration.",
    "DISCUSS": "Discussion\n\u03b1V integrins, which have been implicated in tumor growth and angiogenesis, as well as in sensitivity to chemo- and radiotherapy, have long been recognized as therapeutic targets. However, there are several factors that complicate the development of integrin-based therapeutics for cancer, and deepening the basic knowledge about integrin \u03b1V-adhesion complexes is thus necessary. Recent advances in proteomics have enabled researchers to study IAC composition (adhesome) in detail. Here, we assessed \u03b1V-dependent changes in the adhesome of MDA-MB-435S cells to understand better the increased sensitivity to PTX and VCR and decreased migration observed in this cell line upon integrin \u03b1V knockdown. Our major finding is that KANK2 provides a link between IACs and MTs that determines sensitivity to MT poisons.\nAnalysis of the MDA-MB-435S adhesome detected only \u03b1V and \u03b25 integrin subunits, thus showing that in long term culture these cells use preferentially integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 for adhesion. This result is in accordance with recently published results by, who found predominantly \u03b1V and \u03b25 subunits in the adhesome of human osteosarcoma U2OS, lung carcinoma A549 and melanoma A375 cells in long term culture, whereas other integrin \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits were present at much lower levels. Although we did not detect other integrin subunits, we do not exclude the possibility that MDA-MB-435S cells use integrin \u03b1V\u03b23 or small amounts of other integrin heterodimers in adhesion.\nAmong the ECM proteins detected, vitronectin and periostin are able to bind integrin \u03b1V\u03b25. Major group of cytoskeletal proteins detected in the adhesome were actin-binding proteins, together with several MT-binding and intermediate filament proteins. However, the striking characteristic of MDA-MB-435S adhesome was detection of several proteins from the CMSC (liprin \u03b11 and \u03b21, ELKS, LL5\u03b2, MACF1, KANK1 and 2), the punctate structures behind the lamellipodium that cluster in the vicinity of mature FAs.\nStatistical comparison of adhesomes from clones 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V to MDA-MB-435S adhesome showed reduced abundance of liprin \u03b21 in clone 3\u03b1V. In addition, WB analysis of isolated IAC proteins confirmed reduced abundance of liprin \u03b21 in both 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V clones, compared to MDA-MB-345S cells. In melanoma, liprin \u03b21 was found to be overexpressed and its expression strongly correlated with the expression of KANK1 and KANK2. Talin 1 and liprin \u03b21, both showing reduced abundance in clones 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V, were identified as binding partners of KANK2. Inspection of MS data revealed that, despite a lower number of spectra for CMSC proteins in our cell model, clones 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V show slightly reduced abundance compared to MDA-MB-435S cells, especially for KANK2. By combining these results with literature data on the role of KANK2 as a linker between talin and MTs, we hypothesized that KANK2 is the key protein involved in increased sensitivity to MT poisons and decreased cell migration. Indeed, KANK2 knockdown in MDA-MB-435S cells mimics increased sensitivity to MT poisons and decreased migration previously shown in \u03b1V knockdowns. Our MS data demonstrated small but similar number of spectra for KANK1 and KANK2, thus indicating their similar expression. Therefore, reduced expression of KANK1 as well as similar role of KANK1 in sensitivity to MT poisons cannot be excluded. It is well-known that three out of four KANK family members contribute to microtubule targeting and addressing the issue of isoform-specific roles will be the subject of a further study.\nIF analysis did not show striking changes in actin and MT cytoskeleton upon KANK2 knockdown in MDA-MB-435S cells, unlike integrin \u03b1V knockdown, which led to disorganization of actin with loss of stress fibers. This indicates that KANK2 knockdown in MDA-MB-435S cells did not disrupt FAs nor significantly changed the appearance of the MT cytoskeleton. This conclusion is supported by unchanged cell spreading area upon KANK2 knockdown, whereas knockdown of integrin \u03b1V decreased the cell spreading area. This is in line with depletion of KANK2 in fibroblasts or KANK1 in HeLa cells, which both did not result in any obvious alteration of FAs size or disassembly. We tested the effect of two antitumor drugs with the opposite mechanism of action, PTX which stabilizes and VCR which destabilize microtubules. The increased sensitivity of MDA-MB-435S cells to both MT poisons upon integrin \u03b1V or KANK2 knockdown points to altered MT dynamics in these cells. Consistently, recent data in other cell models have shown that KANK proteins mediate crosstalk between actin and MT cytoskeletons at FAs.\nThe question that arises is whether integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 FAs in MDA-MB-435S cells are the only ones linked to CMSCs through KANK2. Since the KANK localization to adhesions is primarily through talin it is very likely that integrin \u03b1V\u03b23 FAs contain KANK2 as well. Our previously published results have shown that knockdown of either integrin \u03b25 or \u03b23 did not change cell migration, while knockdown using integrin \u03b1V-specific siRNA of both heterodimers \u03b1V\u03b23 and \u03b1V\u03b25, the only integrins containing \u03b1V expressed in MDA-MB-435S cells, dramatically inhibited migration. Additionally, integrin \u03b25 knockdown increased sensitivity of MDA-MB-435S cells to MT poisons, but not as efficiently as integrin \u03b1V knockdown, while integrin \u03b23 knockdown had an opposite effect. We explained these results by a balance effect in MDA-MB-435S cell line in which integrin \u03b25 knockdown increased the expression of integrin \u03b1V\u03b23 heterodimer on the cell surface and vice versa, and concluded that integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 is the one responsible for sensitivity to MT poisons while both integrins \u03b1V (\u03b1V\u03b23 and \u03b1V\u03b25) are implicated in cell migration. KANK2 knockdown would knockdown microtubule localization to all integrin adhesions, whereas \u03b25 knockdown would knock it down only to \u03b25 integrins, so it is not surprising that the effect on cell migration is more pronounced. In conclusion, our results indicate that targeting KANK2 might simultaneously increase sensitivity to MT poisons therapy and decrease migration. Cell-specific effects of KANK 1 or 2 knockdown have been reported: in HeLa cells and podocytes KANK1 knockdown was shown to reduce motility, while KANK2 knockdown in mice kidney fibroblasts increased migration.\nIn summary, the data presented here identify \u03b1V\u03b25 as the main integrin used by MDA-MB-435S cells to make both FAs and RAs. MS analysis revealed many proteins associated with integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 and represents the first published adhesome of this integrin heterodimer. KANK2 was shown to be associated with integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 since its knockdown mimicked initially observed integrin \u03b1V knockdown effects. Therefore, we propose KANK2 as a potential target for increasing sensitivity of melanoma cells to MT poisons and decreasing migration. These data will enable follow-up analyses of signaling mediated by integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 and therefore represent a valuable resource to improve our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the adhesion control of melanoma cell sensitivity to MT poisons and cell migration.",

    "METHODS": "Materials and Methods\nCells and Isolation of Stable Cell Clones\nHuman melanoma cell line MDA-MB-435S (a spindle-shaped variant of the parental MDA-MB-435) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, United States). Cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen, United States), and supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Invitrogen, United States) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 (v/v) in a humidified atmosphere. To construct MDA-MB-435S clones with decreased expression of integrin \u03b1V subunit, pSUPER vector system for the expression of shRNA was used (OligoEngine, United States). Briefly, oligonucleotides were constructed according to the sequence of siRNA specific for integrin subunit \u03b1V (s7568- Ambion, United States), previously used in transient transfection in the same cell model. Oligonucleotides P1 \u2013 GATCCCCGAATATCGGTTGGATTATATTCAAGAGA TATAATCCAACCGATATTCTTTTTA and P2 \u2013 AGCTTAAA AAGAATATCGGTTGGATTATATCTCTTGAATATAATCCAA CCGATATTCGGG were annealed and cloned into HindIII (NEB, United Kingdom) and BglII (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States) digested vector. Resulting plasmid pSuper sh\u03b1V was purified using Miniprep columns (Qiagen, Germany) and transfected into MDA-MB-435S cells using Lipofectamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States). Clones 2\u03b1V and 3\u03b1V were selected using puromycin (0.2 \u03bcg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, United States) according to expression of integrin \u03b1V measured by flow cytometry.\nDrugs, Chemicals, Determination of Cell Survival, and Transient siRNA Transfection\nCis-diamminedichloroplatinum (cisplatin, CDDP) was dissolved in water and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. Vincristine and paclitaxel (all Sigma-Aldrich, United States) were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and DMSO, respectively, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. The 3-((4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT) (Millipore, United States) was dissolved in PBS and stored at 4\u00b0C. The sensitivity of cells to antitumor drugs was determined using MTT assay. Briefly, 24 h after seeding in 96-well tissue culture plates (1\u20131.2 \u00d7 104 cells/well) cells were treated with different concentrations of antitumor drugs. Seventy-two hours later, the absorbance of MTT-formazan product dissolved in DMSO was measured with a microplate reader (Awareness Technology, Inc., United States) at 600 nm. Single siRNA specific for KANK2 (target sequence ATGTCAACGTGCAAGATGA; Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 20 nM, validated by western blot analysis (WB) and immunofluorescence (IF) using KANK2 specific antibody as previously described (Supplementary Table S1). Twenty-four hours after KANK2 knockdown cells were used in MTT or migration assays.\nDetermination of Cell Migration\nFor monitoring cell migration, serum-starved (24 h) cells [8 \u00d7 104 cells in 0.5 mL of DMEM containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA] were placed in the Transwell Cell Culture Inserts (pore size, 8 \u03bcm) (Corning, United States) and left to migrate for 22 h toward 10% (v/v) FBS in DMEM as a chemoattractant. Cells on the upper side of the filters were removed with cotton-tipped swabs, the filters were fixed in paraformaldehyde for 15 min and stained with 1% (w/v) crystal violet in PBS for 90 min. Cells on the underside of the filters were photographed using Olympus BX51TF microscope (five images/sample). The number of cells was determined using ImageJ (NIH, United States) software.\nDetermination of Integrin \u03b1V\u03b23, \u03b1V\u03b25, \u03b1V, and \u03b21 Expression by Flow Cytometry\nFlow cytometry to analyze the expression of \u03b1V\u03b23, \u03b1V\u03b25, \u03b1V, and \u03b21 was performed using integrin subunit- or heterodimer-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAb). Briefly, adherent cells were grown in tissue culture dishes, detached by EDTA (Invitrogen, United States) and washed twice with PBS. Membrane fluorescence staining was performed using unlabeled primary antibodies (1 h, 4\u00b0C) while its binding was revealed by incubation (30 min, 4\u00b0C) of FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Isotype control samples were incubated with mouse IgG1 followed by FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Flow cytometry experiments were performed using FACSCalibur, while cell acquisition was made using BD CellQuest software package (all BD Biosciences, United States). Data were analyzed using FCS Express 3 (De Novo Software, United States) software. All antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table S1.\nAssessment of Apoptosis and Cell Proliferation\nThe induction of apoptosis in MDA-MB-435S, 2\u03b1V, and 3\u03b1V cells was determined by the Annexin V-FITC (BD Pharmingen, Germany)/PI double-staining. Cells were treated for 72 h with PTX (0.004 \u03bcg/mL) and apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. To monitor cell proliferation, Click-iT\u00ae assay was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States). Briefly, 2.75 \u00d7 105 cells/well were seeded on 6-well plate and grown for 72 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS. Two hours before harvesting, modified thymidine analog EdU (5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine, final concentration 10 \u03bcM) was added. Cells were collected, fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with saponin, stained with AF 488 azide (in the presence of CuSO4) and analyzed by flow cytometry. To determine the proliferation rate, the frequencies of the proliferative (EdU +) cells were compared.\nConfocal Microscopy and Live Cell Imaging\nFor confocal microscopy, 48 h after being seeded on coverslips, cells were fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (methanol was used only when staining of \u03b1-tubulin/KANK2 was performed), permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, incubated with the appropriate antibodies for 1 h, followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h. F-actin fibers were stained with rhodamine phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich, United States) while MTs were stained with antibody against \u03b1-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, United States), and slides mounted in DAPI Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, United States) (all antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table S1). Fluorescence and respective IRM images were acquired using HC PL APOCS2 63 \u00d7 /1.40 oil-immersion objective on an inverted confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8 X, Leica Microsystems, Germany), with the focus adjusted to the adhesion sites of cells at the upper surface of glass coverslip. Images were analyzed using LAS X (Leica Microsystems, Germany) and ImageJ (NIH, United States) software. For quantification of FA proteins/KANK2, images were processed using ImageJ and threshold was set to restrict analysis to sites where the signals from the protein staining overlaps with the F-actin/MT staining at the tip of the actin stress fibers/MT fibers. For the stress fiber quantification, only those fibers that end with FAs, marked by paxillin staining, were identified as stress fibers and quantified using ImageJ. For time-lapse live cell imaging, cells were seeded on 35 mm glass bottom dishes (Ibidi, Martinsried, Germany) and 2\u20133 fields containing cells were imaged every 44 s for 18\u201320 h using HC PL APOCS2 40 \u00d7 /1.30 oil-immersion objective on the Leica TCS SP8 X microscope equipped with a top stage incubator at 37\u00b0C. Images were analyzed using LAS X. EVOS cell imaging system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States) was used to obtain cell morphology images of cells seeded in 6-well plates, every 24 h for a 72 h period. Images were analyzed using ImageJ (NIH, United States) software.\nIsolation of IACs, Sample Preparation for Mass Spectrometry, and Data Analysis\nIntegrin adhesion complexes were isolated as previously described. In short, cells (2\u20132.5 \u00d7 106, depending on cell clone, to obtain similar cell number 48 h later) were plated on 10 cm diameter cell culture dishes (at least six dishes per cell line) and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS. After 48 h, the medium was removed, cells were washed with DMEM-HEPES and incubated with Wang and Richard\u2019s reagent for 5 min (6 mM DTBP, Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States). At the same time, cells in an additional plate were counted to ensure equal cell number per sample. DTBP was quenched by 0.03M Tris-HCl (pH 8) and cells were lysed using modified RIPA buffer. Cell bodies were removed by high-pressure washing and remaining adhesions were collected by scraping. Samples containing isolated IACs were acetone precipitated, dissolved in Laemmli buffer and further processed either for MS or WB analysis.\nSamples were prepared as previously described, using a slightly modified procedure. Briefly, samples were loaded onto gradient gels (NuPage 4\u201312% Bis-Tris protein gels, Thermo Fisher Scientific, United Kingdom) and electrophoresis was performed for 3 min (200V). Protein bands were stained with InstantBlue (Expedeon, United Kingdom), followed by excision and destaining using series of alternate washing steps with ammonium bicarbonate (Fluka, United States) and acetonitrile (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United Kingdom). Washing and drying steps were made in 96-well perforated plates (GlySci, United States). Gel pieces were dried with acetonitrile and additional drying was performed using vacuum centrifuge. Samples were reduced with dithiothreitol (DTT, 1 h at 56\u00b0C) and alkylated using 55 mM iodoacetamide (37\u00b0C, 45 min, dark) (both Sigma-Aldrich, United States). After series of washing and drying steps, gel pieces were incubated with trypsin (1.25 ng/\u03bcL, Promega, United States) and incubated for 45 min at 4\u00b0C, followed by an overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C. Peptides were collected and extracted using acetonitrile supplemented with formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, United States), then dried and resuspended in a solution of 5% (v/v) acetonitrile plus 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. Peptides were desalted using OLIGO R3 beads (Life technologies, United States) using 96-well plates with PVDF membranes (Corning, United States). Desalting was performed with a 0.1% formic acid wash steps before being eluted twice with 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were subsequently dried and resuspended in a solution of 5% (v/v) acetonitrile plus 0.1% (v/v) formic acid for LC-MS/MS analysis.\nSamples were analyzed using a modified version of the LC-MS/MS method previously described. Briefly, an UltiMate\u00ae 3000 Rapid Separation LC (RSLC, United States) coupled to an Orbitrap Elite mass detector (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States) with electrospray ionization. Peptide mixtures were eluted for 44 min using a gradient containing 92% of solution A (0.1% formic acid in water) and 8% up to 33% of solution B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). Solvent flow was set to 300 nL per minute. To identify proteins, data were searched against the human Swissprot database (version 2018_01) using Mascot (Matrix science, version 2.5.1). Fragment ion tolerance was set to 0.50 Da, while parent ion tolerance was 5 PPM. Protein identifications were further refined using Scaffold (Proteome software). Protein (99.9%) and peptide (95%) probabilities were assigned using the Protein Prophet algorithm as incorporated by Scaffold including a minimum of four unique peptides per each protein.\nPPI Network Formation, Functional Enrichment, Gene Ontology Analysis, and MS Data Visualization\nHuman protein\u2013protein interactions were loaded from STRING database, using stringApp (confidence score cut-off = 0.40, maximum additional interactors = 0) for Cytoscape software (version 3.7.1). Functional annotation was performed using the Database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID), version 6.8 and Panther GO database, while the literature search was performed in case of cortical stabilization microtubule complex.\nFunctional enrichment was performed using DAVID_CC subontology list (Benjamini\u2013Hochberg corrected P-value < 0.05, EASE score < 0.1, at least four identified proteins). To summarize the gene ontology terms and place them in similarity-based space, REViGO tool, with the following setup (comparison of corrected P-values related to GO terms were used, allowed similarity: small (0.5), semantic similarity measure to use: Resnik-normalized) was used. QSpec Spectral counter tool was used to provide the statistical measure of differentially expressed proteins in MDA-MB-435S versus 2\u03b1V datasets and MDA-MB-435S versus 3\u03b1V datasets. For visualization of differentially expressed proteins, volcano plot (GraphPad Prism) with the following setup was created: fold change > 1.5 (MDA MB 435S/2\u03b1V and MDA MB 435S/3\u03b1V, respectively), \u2212log(FDR) > 1. Fold change was calculated according to Qspec output values.\nWestern Blot Analysis\nIsolated IACs from at least six 10 cm diameter culture dishes were mixed with 2x loading buffer and heated for 20 min at 70\u00b0C. Proteins were loaded onto gradient pre-cast gels (Biorad, United States), separated with SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham, Germany). For assessment of successful KANK2 knockdown cells were lysed using RIPA buffer, mixed with 5x loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham, Germany). The membrane was blocked in 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk, and incubated with the appropriate antibodies, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (GE Healthcare, United States, Invitrogen, United States) (Supplementary Table S1). Detection was performed using chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare) and visualized using iBright CL1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States).\nStatistical Analysis\nEach experiment was repeated at least three times, and GraphPad Prism v5.0 (GraphPad Software, United States) was used to analyze the data. All data from MTT experiments were analyzed by unpaired Student\u2019s t-test, and expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). ns, not significant; \u2217P < 0.05; \u2217\u2217P < 0.01; \u2217\u2217\u2217P < 0.001. Data obtained from migration and IF were analyzed by related measure one-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison: \u2217P < 0.05, \u2217\u2217P < 0.01, \u2217\u2217\u2217P < 0.001.",
