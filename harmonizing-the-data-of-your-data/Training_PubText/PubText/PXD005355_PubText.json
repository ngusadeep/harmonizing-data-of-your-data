    "ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nMost molecular cancer therapies act on protein targets but data on the proteome status of patients and cellular models for proteome\u2010guided pre\u2010clinical drug sensitivity studies are only beginning to emerge. Here, we profiled the proteomes of 65 colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines to a depth of >\u00a010,000 proteins using mass spectrometry. Integration with proteomes of 90 CRC patients and matched transcriptomics data defined integrated CRC subtypes, highlighting cell lines representative of each tumour subtype. Modelling the responses of 52 CRC cell lines to 577 drugs as a function of proteome profiles enabled predicting drug sensitivity for cell lines and patients. Among many novel associations, MERTK was identified as a predictive marker for resistance towards MEK1/2 inhibitors and immunohistochemistry of 1,074 CRC tumours confirmed MERTK as a prognostic survival marker. We provide the proteomic and pharmacological data as a resource to the community to, for example, facilitate the design of innovative prospective clinical trials.",
    "INTRO": "Introduction\nOwing to the high molecular heterogeneity of human cancers, profiling technologies such as genomics and transcriptomics have been employed for some time to identify entity\u2010specific molecular subtypes of tumours that can be used for diagnostic refinement, prediction of disease prognosis or to stratify patients for therapy (McDermott et\u00a0al, 2011). More recently, this concept has been extended to the measurement of cancer proteomes and their post\u2010translational modification status as exemplified by the NCI's Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC; Mertins et\u00a0al, 2016; Zhang et\u00a0al, 2016). The first published CPTAC study was on the proteome of colon and rectal cancer (CRC; Zhang et\u00a0al, 2014), for which extensive transcriptional profiling data had previously been used to define consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) of CRC (Guinney et\u00a0al, 2015). The comparison of subtype information at both transcript and proteome level showed general concordance but also significant discrepancies, with many features only detectable at the protein level. In parallel with molecular profiling of cancers, phenotypic drug screening campaigns in large panels of (mostly) genomically well\u2010characterised cancer cell lines representing many tumour entities have been performed (Barretina et\u00a0al, 2012; Medico et\u00a0al, 2015; Iorio et\u00a0al, 2016; Rees et\u00a0al, 2016). These studies aimed at identifying effective drugs or combinations thereof in cellular model systems that recapitulate the genomic alterations found in human tumours and may thus also show efficacy in humans. However, although genomics might play a role in determining drug sensitivity, given that the majority of drugs act on protein targets, it appears logical to correlate protein expression with drug sensitivity. Recent proteome profiling of the NCI60 cancer cell line panel and a panel of 20 breast cancer cell lines showed that protein signatures predicting drug sensitivity or resistance can be found (Gholami et\u00a0al, 2013; Lawrence et\u00a0al, 2015). Despite these previous efforts, the number of cell lines for any given cancer entity in these panels was limited, impairing the analysis of drug sensitivity for tumour subtypes and possible translation to human patients. Using published transcriptomics data, Medico et\u00a0al (2015) assigned 151 CRC cell lines to different molecular subtypes of CRC patients, in order to identify model systems amenable for drug sensitivity screens in CRC but to date, no comprehensive proteomic dataset on CRC cell lines has been published that would allow for the direct discovery of proteomic signatures of drug sensitivity and resistance in different CRC subtypes.\nIn this study, we measured the proteomes of a panel of 65 well\u2010characterised human colorectal cancer cell lines (Emaduddin et\u00a0al, 2008) to a depth of >\u00a010,000 proteins and integrated this data with the proteome profiles of 90 CRC patients (Zhang et\u00a0al, 2014) and matched transcriptome profiles (Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods) to define integrated proteomic subtypes of CRC. Integration with drug sensitivity data available for 52 CRC cell lines allowed us to predict the drug sensitivity of cell lines and patients towards 577 drugs or combinations thereof. The analysis revealed that, for example, high MAP2K1 (MEK1) expression renders small\u2010molecule EGFR inhibitors less effective and also identified the kinase MERTK to confer partial resistance to MEK1/2 inhibitors. Analysis of 1,074 CRC patients from the QUASAR 2 trial (Kerr et\u00a0al, 2016) proved that high MERTK expression is a prognostic marker for poor survival, defining this receptor tyrosine kinase as an attractive potential target for therapeutic intervention. We are making the proteomic data and our full analysis available to the scientific community to provide a rich resource for aiding in the design of future prospective clinical studies in CRC based on multi\u2010omics molecular tumour data and phenotypic drug sensitivity data.",
    "RESULTS": "Results\nProteome profiles of CRC cell lines and patients\nWe devised a multi\u2010omics data integration strategy to determine integrated proteomic subtypes of human colorectal cancer cell lines and patient samples in order to predict their sensitivity towards a variety of clinical and pre\u2010clinical drugs and combinations thereof (Figs\u00a01A and EV1, Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods). To accomplish this, we first used LC\u2010MS/MS\u2010based shotgun proteomics to measure the proteomes of 65 CRC lines and to quantify their expressed kinomes using Kinobeads (Bantscheff et\u00a0al, 2007; Medard et\u00a0al, 2015). This led to the identification of a total of 11,796 protein groups (median/cell line\u00a0=\u00a09,447) representing 10,951 genes (median/cell line\u00a0=\u00a09,068) and 235 human kinases (median/cell line\u00a0=\u00a0155, from Kinobeads experiments; Fig\u00a02A; Table\u00a0EV1A and B). We next re\u2010analysed the proteomic profiles of 90 CRC patients published by the CPTAC (Zhang et\u00a0al, 2014) using the same analysis pipeline and identified 7,005 protein groups (median/patient\u00a0=\u00a04,980) representing 6,727 gene groups (median/patient\u00a0=\u00a04,901; Fig\u00a02C; Table\u00a0EV1C, Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods). The CRC65 data contained most proteins of the CPTAC CRC data (Fig\u00a02B), but we noted that gene groups unique to the CPTAC dataset are enriched in extracellular matrix proteins and IgGs as one might expect for tissue samples containing blood vessels and connective tissue. For quantification of full proteomes, we used a modified version of the intensity\u2010based absolute quantitation (iBAQ) approach (Schwanhausser et\u00a0al, 2011) termed gene\u2010centric iBAQ (giBAQ, Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods), while kinomes were quantified using the label\u2010free quantification (LFQ) intensities provided by MaxQuant (Cox et\u00a0al, 2014). For all subsequent data analyses, we used the proteomic data aggregated at the gene group level annotated with gene symbols as identifiers in order to be able to compare proteomics and transcriptomics data (referred to as protein expression/abundance throughout the manuscript). An overview of the data integration pipeline is depicted in Fig\u00a0EV1.\nIntegration of multiple mRNA datasets reveals consensus molecular subtypes of the CRC65 panel\nA number of studies have reported CRC patient subtypes based on mRNA measurements, and these were recently consolidated into consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) and applied to patients from the CPTAC study (Guinney et\u00a0al, 2015). On this basis, we sought to determine the CMS membership of CRC cell lines in order to identify cell lines representative of CRC tumour subtypes. We downloaded 10 public mRNA datasets (Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods), eight for the cell lines and two for the patients (Fig\u00a01B), analysed them from the data level closest to raw data available to us and aggregated the datasets using a scheme similar to the one used by Guinney et\u00a0al. This involved the selection of a reference dataset, followed by the selection of a probe set for each gene based on a consistency criterion and subsequent cross\u2010dataset normalisation (Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods). This resulted in a combined expression matrix of 9,737 transcripts (7,113 after filtering for low abundance transcripts) across 145 non\u2010redundant cell lines (including the CRC65 panel) and 89 tumours (Table\u00a0EV1D). We adapted the single\u2010sample CMS classifier reported by Guinney et\u00a0al to accept gene symbols as identifiers (rather than Entrez IDs; Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods) and predicted the CMS for cell lines and patients based on 382 of the 692 classifier genes contained in the combined expression matrix. The correct classification of 65 out of 81 patients (80%, using the original CMS assignment as the ground truth) provided confidence that cell lines can be placed into CMSs with good accuracy and the resulting subtype labels for the CRC65 cell lines and the CPTAC patients are shown in Fig\u00a01B. A subtype\u2010resolved evaluation of the prediction accuracy using a confusion matrix and a table containing a variety of commonly used metrics for evaluating classification performance can be found in Table\u00a0EV2E.\nIntegrated proteomic subtypes of CRC cell lines and tumours\nDespite the fairly deep proteomic measurements, the quantification of proteins across many cell lines (and patients) suffered from an increasing number of missing values for proteins of decreasing abundance (Fig\u00a0EV2A). We addressed this frequently encountered issue by mRNA\u2010guided and minimum\u2010guided missing value imputation on the peptide level to generate one complete protein expression matrix consisting of 59 cell lines, 81 tumours and 6,254 proteins (Fig\u00a0EV2, Table\u00a0EV1E), of which 323 were contained in the CMS classifier by Guinney et\u00a0al (CMSgene in Fig\u00a03A; see Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods for details). In order to estimate protein levels from mRNA levels, we removed systematic differences (Fig\u00a0EV3A and B) between proteomics and transcriptomics data using MComBat (Stein et\u00a0al, 2015; see Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods). This increased the protein/mRNA correlation for both the CRC65 and CPTAC datasets (Figs\u00a0EV2B and EV3C), enabling mRNA\u2010guided missing value imputation. After imputing missing values separately for both datasets (Fig\u00a0EV2D and E, Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods), we accounted for differences in their proteomic depth (Fig\u00a0EV2C, Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods) using ComBat (Johnson et\u00a0al, 2007) before we merged the two protein expression matrices. Using the combined protein expression matrix and consensus clustering (Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods), we identified three integrated Full Proteome Subtypes (short: FPSs, namely FPA, FPB and FPC; Fig\u00a03A). Each subtype consisted of cell lines as well as patients in a ratio of 28/34 for FPA, 22/12 for FPB and 9/26 for FPC, indicating that indeed there are cell lines, which are molecularly more similar to tumours than they are to other cell lines. We measured the association of these FPSs with previously published subtypes, as well as genomic and epigenomic features using Fisher's exact test (Table\u00a0EV2A), and found good overall concordance but with some differences in detail (see discussion). Interestingly, FPA was associated with TP53 mutations, while FPB was associated with ATM mutations, suggesting that p53 signalling in response to DNA damage is perturbed through distinct mechanisms in these two subtypes. FPC showed association with mutations in BCL9L, a transcriptional activator of b\u2010catenin activity, RNF43, an E3 ubiquitin\u2010protein ligase, which acts as a negative regulator of Wnt signalling, as well as with mutations in the histone acetyltransferase EP300, all pointing towards deregulated WNT signalling in conjunction with aberrant histone acetylation. Enrichment analysis of functional classifications using MetaCore (Fig\u00a0EV4, Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods) revealed that proteins significantly under\u2010 or overrepresented in the different FPSs fall into specific categories. Briefly, the analysis suggests that FPA is characterised by a \u201chigh metabolism, low cell cycle, microsatellite stable (MSI\u2212)\u201d signature, FPB harbours a \u201chigh immune response, low metabolism, microsatellite instable (MSI+)\u201d signature and FPC shows a \u201clow immune response, low inflammation, low adhesion (invasion)\u201d signature.\nIntegration of drug sensitivity data reveals protein signatures of drug response\nSince the response to drug treatment cannot be determined as quickly and as broadly as would be desirable in clinical studies, we took advantage of the fact that CRC cell lines recapitulate the main molecular subtypes in CRC and were recently extensively characterised for drug sensitivity as part of major screening efforts. On the basis of the proteomic data, we used elastic net regression (Zou & Hastie, 2005) to predict the response (sensitivity/resistance) of CPTAC patients and CRC65 cell lines to 577 drugs or combinations thereof (Fig\u00a03B, Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods). Briefly, common cell lines (52 cell lines overlap in total; median overlap per drug is 27) between the CRC65 panel and three small\u2010molecule drug sensitivity screens (Barretina et\u00a0al, 2012; Garnett et\u00a0al, 2012; Rees et\u00a0al, 2016) and one study investigating sensitivity of CRC cell lines towards cetuximab (Medico et\u00a0al, 2015) served as the training set (Fig\u00a01, Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods). We used significance analysis of microarrays (SAM; median FDR of 0.001; Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods) to identify drugs which showed specificity for certain FPSs and performed target space enrichment by measuring the association between these subtypes and recurrent annotated targets of these drugs using Fisher's exact test (Fig\u00a03B, Table\u00a0EV2B). Cetuximab, for example, was more effective in FPA than in the other FPSs, with EGFR target enrichment reaching statistical significance (P\u00a0=\u00a00.05). FPA was also significantly (multiple\u2010test adjusted P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) associated with drugs targeting the kinases MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 (MEK1 and 2; mainly selumetinib/AZD6244 and its combinations with other compounds), as well as with drugs and combinations targeting the bromodomain containing protein BRDT (mainly by the compound JQ\u20101), histone deacetylases or HDACs (vorinostat among others) and the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase NAMPT (daporinad among these). Even though more drugs were differentially effective in FPB than in FPA (205 versus 170), most of the former did not show significant enrichment in their target space, making it difficult to link the drug phenotype to the presumed mechanism of action. However, FPB did show positive association with drugs targeting inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs; all these compounds are mimetics of second mitochondrial activator of caspases, SMAC) as well as negative association with drugs targeting EGFR, while FPC showed association with drugs targeting dihydroxyfolate reductase (DHFR, including methotrexate). The complete list of predicted drug sensitivities for the patients and cell lines can be found in Table\u00a0EV3A, while mean effect sizes of all proteins from elastic net regression can be found in Table\u00a0EV3B.\nHigh MERTK expression in CRC cell lines is predictive of resistance to MEK1/2 inhibitors\nSince many targeted cancer drugs act on kinases, we performed independent experiments focussing on the expressed kinome of the CRC65 cell line panel to identify kinases associated with drug sensitivity or resistance. Pulling down protein kinases using immobilised kinase inhibitors (Kinobeads; Bantscheff et\u00a0al, 2007; Medard et\u00a0al, 2015) led to the reproducible (average R\u00a0=\u00a00.91 between replicates; Fig\u00a0EV5A) quantification of 138 kinases by mass spectrometry (Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods), which correlated well (R\u00a0=\u00a00.94; Fig\u00a0EV5B) with data obtained by Western blotting and densitometry for the kinases EPHA4 (Fig\u00a0EV5C; variable expression across the panel) and ABL1 (Fig\u00a0EV5D; relatively stable expression across the CRC65 panel). While kinase expression as measured using Kinobeads correlated reasonably well with measurements in full proteomes, an enrichment of kinases was clearly visible in the Kinobeads data (Fig\u00a0EV5E) and led to the identification and quantification of more than 50 kinases not detected in the deep proteome analysis (Fig\u00a0EV5F). Consensus clustering identified three Kinobeads Subtypes (KSs) KA, KB and KC (Fig\u00a0EV5G) that fully recapitulated the Full Proteome Subtypes and showed significant association with other subtype classifications (Table\u00a0EV2C).\nBy searching for differentially expressed kinases between the different Kinobeads Subtypes using SAM (median FDR of 0.01), we identified proteins frequently mutated in microsatellite instable (MSI+) tumours with concomitant decrease in expression of proteins such as ACVR2A and TGFBR2 (Kim et\u00a0al, 2013), as well as the receptor tyrosine kinase EPHA2, which was overexpressed in KC (Table\u00a0EV4). Overexpression of EPHA2 is known to predict resistance towards cetuximab in CRC (Strimpakos et\u00a0al, 2013). Elastic net regression was used to identify kinases associated with drug sensitivity or resistance and confirmed the strong association of EPHA2 with resistance towards cetuximab (Fig\u00a0EV5H, Table\u00a0EV3C and D). We also noted that overexpression of MAP2K1 (MEK1) was associated with resistance to two\u2010thirds (12/18) of all inhibitors targeting EGFR (Fig\u00a04 for example). Activating mutations in K57 of MAP2K1 were previously shown to be a potential mechanism of primary resistance towards EGFR\u2010targeted therapy (Bertotti et\u00a0al, 2015), and our data suggest that high expression can have a similar effect. SAM also identified MERTK\u2014a receptor tyrosine kinase correlating with disease progression in melanoma (Schlegel et\u00a0al, 2013) and not detected in the full proteome measurements\u2014to be differentially expressed between the different Kinobeads Subtypes (q\u2010value\u00a0<\u00a00.01). MERTK is down\u2010regulated in KRAS\u2010mutant CRC (Watanabe et\u00a0al, 2011) and up\u2010regulated in pancreatic cancer cell lines resistant towards selumetinib (Beech & Kelly, 2014). Interestingly, we also recurrently found high MERTK expression associated with resistance towards MEK1/2 inhibitors as well as other drugs from multiple drug sensitivity datasets (Figs\u00a05A and B, and EV6A, Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods). To validate hypotheses arising from the above predictions, we performed a series of in\u00a0vitro drug treatment experiments.\nOn the basis of MERTK expression, we selected three cell lines (CC07, HDC\u2010143 and SK\u2010CO\u20101) predicted to be sensitive to two MEK1/2 inhibitors (RDEA119 and PD\u20100325901) as well as three cell lines (C10, CaCo\u20102 and T84) predicted to be resistant to these drugs (Fig\u00a0EV6B). Cell viability assays and nuclei counting of cells (Fig\u00a06C and D) showed that the predictions could be confirmed, as cell lines expected to be resistant did not respond as well as cell lines expected to be sensitive (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05, one\u2010sided Mann\u2013Whitney test). Similar results were obtained for the predicted association of ACVR2A expression with drug sensitivity to AUY922 (an HSP90 inhibitor) and BAY 61\u20103606 (a designated SYK inhibitor) in LS\u2010180, OXCO\u20101 and RKO cells (sensitive) or C125\u2010PM, HDC\u2010111 and HT55 cells (resistant; Fig\u00a05C and D). Since ACVR2A expression is reduced in microsatellite instable CRC, these tumours might benefit from treatment with these drugs.\nWe next asked whether knockout of MERTK in MEK1/2\u2010inhibitor\u2010resistant C10 cells could re\u2010sensitise them to treatment with RDEA119 (MEK1/2 inhibitor). A Western blot\u2010based validation of the CRISPR/Cas9\u2010mediated knockout is depicted in Fig\u00a05E. We also confirmed the knockout by sequencing of the targeted genomic region, which showed two insertions: one in exon 7 (FN3 domain) and one in exon 14 (kinase domain), inducing frameshifts. As depicted in Fig\u00a05F,  was more sensitive to RDEA119 than the parental  cell line. We next tested whether the combination of MEK (by RDEA119 or PD\u20100325901) and MERTK inhibition (UNC569) could re\u2010sensitise MEK1/2\u2010inhibitor\u2010resistant cell lines. As shown in Fig\u00a0EV6C\u2013F, co\u2010treatment indeed significantly (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05, one\u2010sided Mann\u2013Whitney test) reduced the viability of MEK1/2 inhibitor\u2010resistant cell lines to levels comparable to sensitive cell lines. However, this reduction appeared to be mainly due to UNC569 on its own, since both MEK1/2 inhibitor\u2010sensitive and resistant cell lines show comparable response to the co\u2010treatment when treated with UNC569 alone.\nMERTK is a prognostic survival marker in CRC patients\nIn order to evaluate the general expression status as well as the clinical impact of MERTK expression in CRC, we quantified its abundance in 1,074 patients enrolled in the QUASAR 2 trial by immunohistochemistry (IHC). After establishing cell\u2010based positive (CaCo\u20102) and negative (RKO) controls with high and low expression of MERTK, respectively (Fig\u00a06A and B), tissue microarrays (TMAs) were stained for MERTK and the fraction of positive cells, as well as the staining intensity, were quantified by pathologists. While MERTK expression was found primarily at the membrane in CaCo\u20102 cells, the TMA data showed combined cytoplasmic and membrane staining. Therefore, TMAs were categorised to have either high or low MERTK expression (more or <\u00a05% cytoplasm/membrane\u2010positive tumour cells, Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods) without distinguishing between these compartments. Figure\u00a06C shows three representative TMA samples alongside their quantification of MERTK, also highlighting the strong variability of MERTK expression in primary tumours. Modelling the outcome variables of the QUASAR 2 trial as a function of MERTK expression showed that high MERTK expression was prognostic of worse 5\u2010year overall survival (OS), disease\u2010free survival (DFS) and recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) in both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression (Table\u00a0EV5, Fig\u00a06D). Notably, MERTK expression is more informative in predicting these outcome variables than the patients\u2019 treatment status, since its coefficient was significant in the final multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, while the coefficient of the treatment variable was not (see also Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods). Comparing tumours with high versus low MERTK expression resulted in a multivariate hazard ratio (HR) of 1.61 for OS (CI0.95\u00a0=\u00a01.1\u20132.36; significant coefficient for MERTK with P\u00a0=\u00a00.015; Wald test), 1.70 for DFS (CI0.95\u00a0=\u00a01.24\u20132.33; significant coefficient for MERTK with P\u00a0=\u00a00.00094; Wald test) and 1.77 for RFS (CI0.95\u00a0=\u00a01.26\u20132.48; significant coefficient for MERTK with P\u00a0=\u00a00.00087; Wald test), respectively. High expression of MERTK was also significantly associated with BRAFV600E mutations (12% of the CRC65 cell line panel and 13% of the QUASAR 2 cohort carry the mutation, Fig\u00a0EV5D) and stage T4 tumours, while low cytoplasmic/membranous expression was associated with wild\u2010type BRAF and stage T2/T3 tumours (two\u2010sided Fisher's exact test P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, Table\u00a0EV2D). We note that more work is needed in order to determine the direction of causality for these observations and whether MERTK might qualify as a drug target in CRC in addition to being a prognostic survival marker in CRC patients.",
    "DISCUSS": "Discussion\nRecent landmark studies established resources like the \u201cGenomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer\u201d (GDSC; Iorio et\u00a0al, 2016), the \u201cCancer Cell Line Encyclopedia\u201d (CCLE; Barretina et\u00a0al, 2012) and the \u201cCancer Therapeutics Response Portal\u201d (CTRP; Rees et\u00a0al, 2016), all of which focus on the identification of genomic and transcriptomic associations with drug sensitivity. However, since drugs almost always target proteins, it appears obvious to incorporate proteome\u2010wide measurements into drug sensitivity association studies. Here, we overlaid these large\u2010scale drug sensitivity datasets and data on cetuximab (Medico et\u00a0al, 2015) onto extensive proteomic profiles of 65 colon cancer cell lines, created as part of this study and 90 published human colon cancer proteomes (Zhang et\u00a0al, 2014; re\u2010processed for this study) in order to identify molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer and molecular markers of drug response with translational potential to the human disease.\nIt was shown before that cell lines included in the CRC65 panel might capture core molecular subtypes of CRC (Mouradov et\u00a0al, 2014; Medico et\u00a0al, 2015); however, the recently established consensus molecular subtype CMS of these cell lines was not known as of yet. By combining and re\u2010analysing multiple public mRNA datasets acquired using a variety of technologies across a number of laboratories involving several different batches of cell lines cultivated under a diverse set of conditions, we were able to assign 42 of them to a defined CMS subtype using the single\u2010sample classifier developed by Guinney et\u00a0al (2015), confirming that these cell lines indeed represent the main molecular subtypes of CRC. Dunne et\u00a0al recently noted that patients might be misclassified by the CMS classifier due to regional heterogeneity in tumours arising from stromal contributions to measured gene expression (Dunne et\u00a0al, 2016), highlighting the need for independent unsupervised class discovery while searching for representative cell lines. This might also explain why the cluster in Fig\u00a01B containing most of the CMS4 tumours did not contain cell lines annotated as CMS4, since cell lines only capture the epithelial component of a tumour. The transcriptional profiles of the cell lines were consistent across the different datasets if systematic differences between them were accounted for.\nCombining the CRC65 and CPTAC datasets then enabled the identification of integrated Full Proteome Subtypes of CRC (consisting of cell lines and patients), which were associated with previously published mRNA\u2010based and proteomics\u2010based subtypes. Since the CMS represent the current consensus in the field, we note that they could only be partially recapitulated from proteomics data. The data analysis grouped CMS1 and CMS4 together into Full Proteome Subtype FPB, which might be explained by the fact that mesenchymal genes overrepresented in CMS4 are mainly of stromal rather than epithelial origin and will therefore largely evade detection in cell culture experiments (Calon et\u00a0al, 2015; Isella et\u00a0al, 2015). Despite this loss in granularity, the data identified clear proteomic signatures characterised by \u201chigh metabolism, low cell cycle, MSI\u2212\u201d for FPA, \u201chigh immune response, low metabolism, MSI+\u201d for FPB and \u201clow immune response, low inflammation, low adhesion (invasive)\u201d for FPC.\nDue to the substantial overlap of our CRC65 full proteome data on cell lines with the CPTAC patient data, we were able to predict the drug sensitivity of both cell lines and patients towards 577 drugs or combinations thereof as a function of protein profile. This allowed us to confirm a number of known and suggest a number of novel promising drugs and targets specific to the integrated Full Proteome Subtypes identified in this project. One example of a known subtype\u2010specific drug is cetuximab, which was more effective in FPA than in FPB or FPC. Since FPA was associated with (i.e. is similar to) the transit\u2010amplifying (TA) subtype from the subtype model by Sadanandam et\u00a0al (Table\u00a0S2A), our analysis confirmed previous findings on cell lines and patients where cetuximab sensitivity was recurrently observed in the TA subtype (Sadanandam et\u00a0al, 2013). Interestingly, modelling drug sensitivity as a function of kinase protein expression also confirmed previous findings by Strimpakos et\u00a0al (2013), as high expression of EPHA2 was associated with resistance towards cetuximab. Since the Kinobeads\u2010based expression level of EPHA2 was significantly lower in KB/FPA than in the other subtypes, one might speculate that treatment with EPHA2\u2010targeted drugs might re\u2010sensitise cetuximab\u2010resistant patients and cell lines to the antibody. Koch et\u00a0al previously made similar observations for non\u2010small\u2010cell lung cancer and proposed a model in which EGFR and EPHA2 functionally interact to mediate resistance to EGFR inhibition (Koch et\u00a0al, 2015). Target space enrichment analysis then facilitated the identification of proteins, which are recurrently targeted by drugs specific to certain FPSs. This analysis enabled the suggestion of target\u2010based treatment options for each FPS, while the drug sensitivity predictions themselves provide more detailed information for the selection of rational treatment regimens as part of, for example, prospective clinical trials. For example, selumetinib (MEK inhibitor), lapatinib (EGFR inhibitor) and vorinostat (HDAC inhibitor) were specific to FPA, SN\u201038 (topoisomerase inhibitor) and sorafenib (a RAF inhibitor) were specific to FPB, while AZD7762 (checkpoint kinase inhibitor) and methotrexate (DHFR inhibitor) were specific to FPC. Together with our target space enrichment analysis, this suggested that patients of the FPA subtype might profit most from drugs targeting the classical MAPK signalling cascade or acetylation\u2010based epigenetic modifications, patients of the FPB subtype might benefit most from drugs promoting apoptosis and patients of the FPC subtype might be best served by DHFR\u2010targeted drugs.\nThe kinase\u2010centric drug sensitivity analysis found high expression of MAP2K1 (MEK1) frequently associated with resistance towards EGFR inhibitors, and high expression of MERTK recurrently associated with resistance towards MEK1/2 inhibitors. While activating mutations of K57 in MAP2K1 are known to play a role in the development of resistance towards EGFR\u2010targeted treatments (Bertotti et\u00a0al, 2015), to our knowledge, MERTK was so far only shown to be up\u2010regulated on the mRNA level in pancreatic cancer cell lines resistant towards the MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib (Beech & Kelly, 2014). We were able to confirm the predictive potential of MERTK protein expression for CRC cell lines in\u00a0vitro. In addition, exploration of MERTK expression levels in tumours using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (TMAs) showed that high MERTK expression is a biomarker for worse overall, disease\u2010free and recurrence\u2010free survival in CRC patients. Aberrant expression of MERTK was observed previously in a variety of cancers (Graham et\u00a0al, 2014). We showed that high MERTK expression was associated with stage T4 tumours. Tavazoie et\u00a0al (2008) suggested that MERTK is a target of miR\u2010335\u2010dependent post\u2010transcriptional regulation. Since miR\u2010335 was shown to be down\u2010regulated in aggressive CRC and breast cancer (Tavazoie et\u00a0al, 2008; Sun et\u00a0al, 2014), one could speculate that aberrant expression of MERTK in CRC may be due to down\u2010regulation of miR\u2010335. Given that MERTK is a receptor tyrosine kinase, the protein might also be an actionable target for the treatment of advanced CRC, possibly in combination with MEK1/2 inhibitors. However, further work is needed to evaluate whether MERTK inhibition alone or combination treatments have clinical potential in CRC. In the light of the fact that, for example, the approved drugs crizotinib and sunitinib are also potent MERTK inhibitors and that the designated compound MRX\u20102843 will soon enter clinical trials, such investigations are becoming feasible in future.",
    "FIG": "Study design, datatypes & CMS prediction for cell lines\nOverview of the multi\u2010omics data integration workflow followed in this study. Proteomic and transcriptomic data generated as part of this study or available from the literature for colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines and patients were integrated in order to identify cell lines and tumours forming proteomic subtypes. Four published drug sensitivity datasets (abbreviated CCLE, CTRP, GDSC and cetuximab (Medico et\u00a0al, 2015); one dose\u2013response plot for each data source in shown) were overlaid onto the proteomic data to identify protein signatures associated with sensitivity or resistance. An example of an effect\u2010size heat map for one drug, ten proteins and 20 cell lines is shown at the bottom\u2010right (see main text and Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods for details).\nCircos plot visualising the different datasets that were integrated in this study. The dendrogram in the centre hierarchically ordered tumours (violet \u201cDataset\u201d label) and cell lines (blue \u201cDataset\u201d label) based on the mRNA expression of classifier genes from Guinney et\u00a0al (2015). A set of rings around the dendrogram indicates which proteomics data (full proteome, kinome), mRNA technologies (Agilent microarray, Genome\u2010Analyser\u2010based mRNA\u2010Seq, HiSeq\u20102000\u2010based mRNA\u2010Seq, Affymetrix microarrays or Illumina Beadarrays) and drug sensitivity datasets (cetuximab, CCLE, CTRP or GDSC) were included in this study. The outermost ring indicates the membership of cell lines/tumours in a consensus molecular subtype (\u201cCMS\u201d). Undetermined CMS class labels or unavailable data were left white (see main text and Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods for details). See also Fig\u00a0EV1.\nData integration pipeline (related to Fig\u00a01)\nOverview of the data integration pipeline. Raw data (no box) at the top were subjected to different processing steps (filled box\u2010arrows), which resulted in processed datasets (filled boxes). These were in turn used to generate figures and tables (open boxes). The intersect symbol \u201c\u2229\u201d was used to denote datasets, which were integrated based on their intersection. The different proteomic datasets were colour\u2010coded as in the main manuscript (green\u00a0=\u00a0Kinobeads, blue\u00a0=\u00a0CRC65 full proteomes and purple\u00a0=\u00a0CPTAC full proteomes; see main text and Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods for details).\nLC\u2010MS/MS\u2010based identifications\nBar charts visualising the number of unique identified and quantified peptides, protein groups and gene groups (full proteomes), as well as kinase gene groups (Kinobeads), across the CRC65 cell line panel (n\u00a0=\u00a065 cell lines). Insets indicate the corresponding number of identifications across the entire dataset.\nVenn diagrams showing the intersection and complements with respect to identifications in the aforementioned categories across both the CRC65 cell line and CPTAC patient dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a089 tumours). Kinase identifications in the CPTAC dataset were extracted from the full proteome data.\nSame as (A) for the CPTAC dataset. The different proteomic datasets were colour\u2010coded (green\u00a0=\u00a0Kinobeads, blue\u00a0=\u00a0CRC65 full proteomes and purple\u00a0=\u00a0CPTAC full proteomes).\nProtein/mRNA correlation & missing value imputation (related to Fig\u00a03)\nBar chart of the fraction of missing values per intensity bin, relative to the respective dataset.\nScatterplot of median mRNA expression before MComBat adjustment for all transcripts across all cell lines versus protein expression in both the CRC65 cell line and CPTAC patient datasets (log2\u2010transformed & median\u2010centred giBAQ; diagonal: x\u00a0=\u00a0y; lm: linear model; R\n2: coefficient of determination).\nScatterplot of the number of peptides per protein used for the calculation of giBAQ values in the CPTAC dataset versus the CRC65 dataset. The quantification of the majority of all proteins is based on more peptides in the CRC65 dataset compared to the CPTAC dataset (lm: linear model; R\n2: coefficient of determination; see main text and Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods for details).\nHistograms visualising the distribution of log2\u2010transformed and median\u2010centred giBAQ values of the CRC65 (top row) and CPTAC (bottom row) datasets after application of (D) mRNA\u2010guided, (E) sequential mRNA\u2010guided and perseus\u2010type, as well as sequential mRNA\u2010guided and minimum\u2010guided missing value imputation on the protein or peptide level, respectively. Additional lines visualise the contribution of measured values (green), values imputed by mRNA\u2010guided missing value imputation (yellow) and values imputed by either perseus\u2010type or minimum\u2010guided missing value imputation (red, see also Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods).\nFrom integrated proteomic subtypes to drug sensitivity prediction\nHeat map of standardised, log2\u2010transformed and median\u2010centred giBAQ protein quantification (z\u2010scores) across the combined CRC65/CPTAC dataset. Cell lines/patients are displayed as columns and proteins are shown as rows. Black bars to the left of the heat map indicate the presence of the respective protein in the CMS classifier. Annotation bars on top of the heat map visualise the membership of the different cell lines/patients in five annotation categories.\nElastic net regression was used to model drug sensitivity as a function of protein profile with the CCLE, CTRP, GDSC and cetuximab datasets as input. The resulting models were used to predict the drug sensitivity of cell lines/patients (see also Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods). In the heat map of standardised predicted AUC values (z\u2010scores), cell lines/patients are displayed as columns with the same annotations and ordering as in (A), while drugs or combinations thereof are shown as rows. Coloured bars to the left of the heat map indicate drugs, which are more effective in a respective subtype (see main text and Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods for details). See also Figs\u00a0EV2, EV3 and EV4.\nEstimating protein levels from mRNA levels (related to Fig\u00a03)\nProtein/mRNA ratios (log10) for four proteins plotted across the CRC65 and CPTAC datasets show that this ratio is relatively stable for a given protein/mRNA.\nDistribution of the median absolute fold\u2010change in protein/mRNA ratios, relative to the protein\u2010wise median protein/mRNA ratio, indicating that variation in the protein/mRNA ratios was typically below twofold. The median is marked with a bold horizontal line inside a box spanning the interquartile range (IQR) from the 25% quantile (q\n25%; lower horizontal line) to the 75% quantile (q\n75%; upper horizontal line), while the whiskers extend to a = q\n25% \u2212 1.5 \u00d7 IQR and b = q\n75% + 1.5 \u00d7 IQR. Outliers according to the standard boxplot definition (x < a, as well as x > b) were excluded for visual clarity.\nScatterplot of median mRNA expression after MComBat adjustment for all transcripts across all cell lines/tumours versus protein expression in the CRC65 and CPTAC datasets, indicating that protein levels can be estimated reasonably well from transcript levels (lm: linear model; R\n2: coefficient of determination; see main text and Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods for details).\nEnriched Process Networks, Pathway Maps & GO terms (related to Fig\u00a03)\nBar chart visualising the negative logarithm to the base of ten with respect to the enrichment q\u2010value of process networks significantly (minimum q\u2010value\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05, MetaCore) enriched in proteins down\u2010regulated (to the left of the origin) or up\u2010regulated (to the right of the origin) in the different FPSs.\nSame as (A) for pathway maps.\nTreemaps generated from R scripts as downloaded from REViGO after summarisation of GO terms significantly (minimum q\u2010value\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05, MetaCore) enriched in proteins down\u2010 or up\u2010regulated in the different FPSs.

Densitometry was performed using ImageStudioLite v5.2.5 (LI\u2010COR), expressing EPHA4 and ABL1 expression relative to the respective ERK1/2 signal, followed by dividing all expression values by the expression value of OXCO\u20101 (present on each gel) and log2\u2010transformation. LFQ log2\u2010ratios were based on log2\u2010transformed and median\u2010centred LFQ intensities after ComBat adjustment. We reverted the log2\u2010transformation and divided all LFQ values by the LFQ value of OXCO\u20101, followed by log2\u2010transformation of the resulting ratios. Cell lines harbouring the BRAFV600E mutation are visualised using a mutation\u2010specific antibody.\nScatterplot of kinase expression as quantified using CRC65 full proteome measurements versus Kinobeads experiments. Kinase expression is systematically higher in the Kinobeads data.\nVenn diagram of kinase identifications in the CRC65 full proteome and Kinobeads experiments. The two datasets are relatively complementary to each other. The datasets were colour\u2010coded as in the main manuscript (green\u00a0=\u00a0Kinobeads, blue\u00a0=\u00a0CRC65 full proteomes).\nHeat map of standardised, log2\u2010transformed and median\u2010centred LFQ kinase quantification (z\u2010scores) across the CRC65 dataset. Cell lines are displayed as columns and kinases are shown as rows (kinases measured in at least two biological replicates across at least one\u2010third of the cell lines were used to find subtypes). Black bars to the left of the heat map indicate the presence of the respective kinase in the CMS classifier. Annotation bars on top of the heat map visualise the membership of the different cell lines/patients in five annotation categories. Columns are ordered hierarchically according to the consensus clustering results, while rows are ordered according to their association with a particular KS (see Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods).\nEffect\u2010size heat map of cetuximab visualising EPHA2 as a robust predictive marker of resistance.\nMAP2K1 is a predictive marker for inhibitors targeting EGFR\nEffect\u2010size heat maps of six drugs (see titles of panels) targeting EGFR. It is evident that the different drugs showed different profiles but also that high MAP2K1 expression (blue/red gradient across cell lines) was consistently associated with drug resistance (dark blue/yellow gradient across cell lines; AUC: area under the curve; see main text and Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods for details). See also Fig\u00a0EV5.\nMERTK is a predictive marker for inhibitors targeting MEK1/2 in CRC cell lines\nEffect\u2010size heat maps of two drugs (one from two different drug sensitivity screens) targeting MEK1/2 show consistent association of high MERTK expression with drug resistance. The colour scheme is the same as in Fig\u00a04.\nBar chart visualising the top kinases recurrently associated (absolute effect size\u00a0>\u00a00) with drug resistance (top seven bars) and sensitivity (bottom seven bars) in the GDSC and CCLE drug sensitivity datasets.\nDose\u2013response curves of two drugs for which high MERTK (left panels) or ACVR2A (right panels) expression was predicted to confer drug resistance. For each drug, three cell lines predicted to be sensitive (dark blue) and three cell lines predicted to be resistant (yellow) were assayed for viability. The experimental data validated that cell lines predicted to be more sensitive to a drug indeed showed this phenotype (data represent the average of three technical replicates; see Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods for details).\nBoxplots summarising the data shown in panel (C) using the area under the curve (AUC) as a measure for drug sensitivity. The whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum AUC for a given drug and sensitivity prediction, while the median AUC is marked with a bold horizontal line inside a box spanning the interquartile range (IQR) from the 25% quantile (lower horizontal line) to the 75% quantile (upper horizontal line). High AUC values indicate drug resistance. Again, it is evident that cell lines predicted to be more resistant to a certain drug were in fact significantly (*P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05, one\u2010sided Mann\u2010Whitney test) more resistant than cell lines predicted to be more sensitive.\nWestern blot of  and  cells, visualising successful knockout by CRISPR/Cas9.\nDose\u2013response curve of RDEA119 (MEK1/2 inhibitor) in  and  cells.

See also Fig\u00a0EV6.\nCo\u2010treatment with UNC569 (MERTK inhibitor) and MEK inhibitors is more effective than treatment with MEK inhibitors alone (related to Fig\u00a05)\nEffect\u2010size heat maps of two drugs (one from two datasets) targeting MEK1/2 show consistent association of high MERTK expression with drug resistance, even when drug sensitivity is modelled based on all proteins in the Kinobeads expression matrix (see Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods).\nBoxplots of MERTK expression (log2\u2010transformed and median\u2010centred LFQ values after ComBat adjustment) in cell lines predicted to be sensitive (CC07, HDC\u2010143, SK\u2010CO\u20101; dark blue) or resistant (C10, CaCo\u20102, T84; yellow) towards two MEK1/2 inhibitors RDEA119 and PD\u20100325901. The whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum expression of MERTK for cell lines with a given sensitivity prediction, while the median expression of MERTK is marked with a bold horizontal line inside a box spanning the interquartile range (IQR) from the 25% quantile (lower horizontal line) to the 75% quantile (upper horizontal line). Resistant cell lines show significantly higher expression of MERTK than sensitive ones (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05, one\u2010sided Mann\u2013Whitney test).\n10\u2010point dose\u2013response curves of (C) the MERTK inhibitor UNC569, (D) two MEK1/2 inhibitors RDEA119 and PD\u20100325901 and (E) their constant\u2010ratio combination (see Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods) for the same cell lines as in (B) from our own in\u00a0vitro experiments.

    "METHODS": "Materials and Methods\nCell lines\nAll cell lines in the CRC65 panel apart from SW480 (kind gift from Ulrike Stein from the MDC, Berlin) were collected by the laboratory of Prof Sir Walter Bodmer FRS at the University of Oxford and were previously HLA\u2010typed and characterised for other genetic changes to determine whether they are derived from cancers of different donors (Emaduddin et\u00a0al, 2008). Information on the CRC65 cell lines and the CPTAC tumour samples like MSI status, original sources (cell lines) or subtype membership is compiled in Table\u00a0EV6A.\nPatient samples\nWe analysed the expression of MERTK in 1,074 patients from the QUASAR 2 clinical trial cohort, with approval from the West Midlands Research Ethics Committee (Edgbaston, Birmingham, UK; REC reference: 04/MRE/11/18). All participants provided written informed consent for treatment, and separate consent was obtained regarding the use of tumour tissue. QUASAR 2 is a phase III international randomised controlled trial, which collected data on toxicity, overall survival (OS), disease\u2010free survival (DFS) and recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) for 1,941 stage II/III CRC patients, with the aim to determine the efficacy of adjuvant capecitabine\u00b1bevacizumab after resection of the primary tumour. A biobank comprising 1,350 FFPE blocks was established, and tissue microarrays (TMAs) were generated from 1.2\u2010mm cores.\nCell culture and lysis\nSlightly altering the culture conditions described by Emaduddin et\u00a0al (2008), cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM, including GlutaMAX and pyruvate; PAA) containing 1% Pen\u2010Strep (penicillin at 100 units/ml and streptomycin at 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml final concentration, PAA) and 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS, SLI EU\u2010000F Batch 503005) in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C and 10% CO2 using T\u2010175 flasks (Corning). Hereafter, this medium composition is referred to as \u201cculture medium\u201d and the culture conditions apart from the culture vessel are referred to as \u201cstandard culture conditions\u201d. Adherent cells were harvested at ~80\u201390% confluency. Suspension cells (e.g. HDC\u2010135) growing in 250\u00a0ml of culture medium were harvested by centrifugation in 250\u2010ml centrifuge tubes (Corning) at 300\u00a0\u00d7g and 4\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. We used RIPA100 buffer (20\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.5, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 100\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS) containing protease (Complete\u2122 mini with EDTA; Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Phosphatase Inhibitor cocktail 1 and 2; Sigma Aldrich) at 2\u00d7 and 5\u00d7 the final concentration recommended by the manufacturer, respectively, and lysed the cells for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. After clearing the total cell lysates (TCLs) at 22,000\u00a0\u00d7g for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, the protein concentration was determined using a Coomassie\u2010based protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher) and the TCLs were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further use.\nCell viability assays\nWe performed in\u00a0vitro cell viability assays in order to test our in silico predictions. Assays were performed as described previously (Garnett et\u00a0al, 2012), with minor modifications. Cell viability assays were carried out in technical triplicates in order to generate 10\u2010point dose\u2013response curves for drugs with the resistance of which either ACVR2A or MERTK was associated. For each drug, we selected three cell lines predicted to be resistant and three cell lines predicted to be sensitive towards the respective drug and seeded them in 100\u00a0\u03bcl culture medium at their optimal seeding density on day zero (C10\u00a0=\u00a04,000, CaCo\u20102\u00a0=\u00a02,000, CC07\u00a0=\u00a04,000, HDC\u2010143\u00a0=\u00a012,000, SK\u2010CO\u20101\u00a0=\u00a08,000, T84\u00a0=\u00a011,000, RKO\u00a0=\u00a04,000, LS 180\u00a0=\u00a02,000, HDC\u2010111\u00a0=\u00a04,000, HT55\u00a0=\u00a012,000, OXCO\u20101\u00a0=\u00a08,000, C125\u2010PM\u00a0=\u00a011,000). Following an overnight incubation under standard culture conditions, 50\u00a0\u03bcl of fresh medium containing either 1% DMSO or the respective drug in a 9\u2010point twofold dilution series in 1% DMSO was added to the corresponding wells. This resulted in a final DMSO concentration of 0.33%, while the highest final drug concentration was 10\u00a0\u03bcM for UNC569 (Merck), as well as 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM for PD\u20100325901, 5\u00a0\u03bcM for RDEA119, 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM for AUY922 (all from Cambridge Bioscience) and 16\u00a0\u03bcM for BAY 61\u20103606 (Insight Biotechnology), respectively. For drug co\u2010treatments, the respective compounds were combined at constant ratios over the entire concentration range used for the single\u2010agent treatments, keeping the final DMSO concentration in the assay at 0.33%. After 72\u00a0h of incubation time under standard culture conditions, the medium was either replaced with 150\u00a0\u03bcl of fresh culture medium containing 1\u00a0\u03bcM of Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher #H3570) or 10\u00a0\u03bcl AlamarBlue (Thermo Fisher #88952) added to each well (only  and ). Cells were incubated under standard culture conditions for 1\u00a0h or 4\u00a0h, respectively, before they were either imaged using an In Cell Analyzer 6000 automated confocal microscope (GE Healthcare) with four fields of view (FOVs) per well or before AlamarBlue fluorescence was quantified using a FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech). The Hoechst 33342 channel of all images was subsequently analysed with Columbus v2.6.0 (PerkinElmer) using two of the built\u2010in algorithms \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d to automatically segment nuclei. For each well, we then counted the number of nuclei satisfying standard quality control criteria in all four FOVs. Subsequently, the nuclei count or AlamarBlue fluorescence was normalised to the mean of the corresponding DMSO controls, followed by dose\u2013response modelling and parameter extraction (Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods).\nCRISPR/Cas9 targeting of MERTK in C10 cells\nKnockout of MERTK in C10 cells was installed by CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting as described previously (Ran et\u00a0al, 2013). Guide RNA sequences were selected by using the CRISPR Design Tool (http://www.genome-engineering.org/crispr/?page_id=41). Three guide RNAs targeting exons 7, 8 (encoding the FNIII domain) and 14 (encoding the kinase domain) of MERTK were obtained, which were designed to induce double\u2010strand breaks at position 982, 1,273 and\u00a01,882\u00a0bp. The guide RNA sequences were cloned into pSpCas9(BB)\u20102A\u2010GFP (the vector was a gift from Feng Zhang; Addgene plasmid #48138) by standard Golden Gate Assembly using the BbsI site, followed by transformation of chemically competent DH5\u03b1 cells. Three colonies of each sgRNA transformation were picked and the correct insertion confirmed by sequencing. C10 cells were transfected with a mixture of all three sgRNAs using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were microscopically identified by expression of GFP and sub\u2010cloned 3\u00a0days post\u2010transfection using cloning rings. After 2\u20134\u00a0weeks, individual cell clones were tested for successful knockout of MERTK by Western blot and sequencing.\nWestern blots\nTotal cell lysates were diluted to 1\u00a0mg/ml protein concentration and 1\u00d7 final sample buffer concentration with 4\u00d7 sample buffer (70\u00a0mM Tris pH 6.8, 5% v/v 2\u2010mercaptoethanol, 40% v/v glycerol, 3% w/v SDS, 0.05% w/v bromophenol blue) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further use. Samples were separated using 4\u201012% NuPAGE Bis\u2010Tris mini/midi gels (70\u00a0\u03bcg/14\u00a0\u03bcg per sample) and subsequently blotted to Hybond\u2010P PVDF (Amersham) or nitrocellulose (iBlot Transfer Stack, Thermo Fisher) membranes according to the manufacturer's instructions. We used primary antibodies against EPHA4 (ab157588, 1:500, Abcam), ABL1 (OP20, 1:1,000, Merck), BRAFV600E (E19290, 1:500, Spring Bioscience) and ERK1/2 (#4695, 1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology) for PVDF and primary antibodies against MERTK (ab52968, 1:2,000, Abcam) and ACTB (sc\u201047778, 1:1,000, Santa Cruz) for nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated in the dark with appropriate fluorophore\u2010coupled secondary antibodies (IRDye 800CW goat anti\u2010mouse IgG #926\u201032210, IRDye 680RD donkey anti\u2010rabbit IgG #926\u201068023, IRDye 800CW goat anti\u2010rabbit IgG #926\u201032211 and IRDye 680RD goat anti\u2010mouse IgG #925\u201068070). Membranes were measured using an Odyssey near\u2010infrared scanner (LI\u2010COR). Densitometry of Western blots was carried out using ImageStudioLite v5.2.5 (LI\u2010COR), expressing EPHA4 and ABL1 expression relative to the respective ERK1/2 signal, followed by dividing all expression values by the expression value of OXCO\u20101 (present on each gel) and log2\u2010transformation.\nImmunohistochemistry\nIn order to evaluate MERTK expression in tissue microarrays, a staining protocol was developed using positive and negative control cell lines for MERTK expression, selected based on the expression level as measured by LC\u2010MS/MS. For each of the four control cell lines (negative: RKO, CC07; positive: HT55, CaCo\u20102), we grew one T\u2010175 flask under standard culture conditions in culture medium to ~70% confluency, washed the cells once with 10\u00a0ml ice\u2010cold PBS and subsequently scraped them into 2\u00a0ml 4% PFA in PBS, followed by centrifugation at 400\u00a0\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min and fixation overnight. Afterwards, the cell pellets were embedded in paraffin using standard procedures. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of QUASAR 2 TMAs and FFPE control cell pellets was carried out as already described (Schlegel et\u00a0al, 2013), with minor modifications. Stainings quantifying MERTK expression were performed using the Bond\u2010MAX automated IHC system (Leica Biosystems) at room temperature if not specified otherwise. After deparaffinising and re\u2010hydrating the slides, heat\u2010induced epitope retrieval (HIER) was performed for 10\u00a0min at 100\u00b0C with epitope retrieval solution 1 (AR9961, pH 6). MERTK was detected using the Bond Polymer Refine Detection Kit (DS9800) together with a primary antibody against MERTK (ab52968, 1:1,000, Abcam) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by counterstaining nuclei with haematoxylin solution (<\u00a00.1% haematoxylin). Slides were washed, dehydrated with an increasing alcohol series (30\u00a0s in 50, 70, 100 and 100% EtOH), cleared with two 30\u2010s washes in 100% xylene and subsequently mounted using DPX mountant (Sigma Aldrich). Finally, slides were scanned at 40\u00d7 magnification using a ScanScope (Aperio).\nSample processing for mass spectrometry\nFull proteomes\nAcetone precipitation and re\u2010solubilisation\nTCLs were first acetone\u2010precipitated overnight using four volumes of pre\u2010cooled (\u221240\u00b0C) acetone to remove detergents, followed by two additional washing steps with 1\u00a0ml fresh, cold acetone. In between precipitation and washing steps, samples were centrifuged for 10\u00a0min at 13,000\u00a0\u00d7g and 4\u00b0C. After the final washing step, the supernatant was taken off and the samples were left to dry in a fume hood at room temperature. Following acetone precipitation, the samples were re\u2010suspended in urea buffer (40\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl pH\u00a0=\u00a07.6, 8\u00a0M urea) containing protease (Complete mini without EDTA; Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Phosphatase Inhibitor cocktail 1 and 2; Sigma Aldrich) at 1\u00d7 and 5\u00d7 the final concentration recommended by the manufacturer, respectively, as well as 20\u00a0nM calyculin A. In order to ensure proper re\u2010solubilisation of proteins, the precipitates were first mixed thoroughly by pipetting up and down, followed by sonication of each sample for 5\u00a0min on ice using an HF generator GM mini20, equipped with an ultrasonic converter UW mini20 and a microtip MS 2.5 sonotrode (Bandelin), which was set to 3\u2010s pulses at 30% intensity with 3\u2010s pause in between. After re\u2010solubilisation, the protein concentration of the lysate was determined again using a Coomassie\u2010based protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher).\nIn\u2010solution digestion\nFor in\u2010solution digestion of proteins, 3.5\u00a0mg of TCL per sample was reduced with 10\u00a0mM DTT and subsequently alkylated using 55\u00a0mM chloroacetamide. Afterwards, samples were diluted with 40\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.6 to reduce the urea concentration to 1.5\u00a0M, 1.5\u00a0\u03bcl of CaCl2 was added to each sample and proteins were digested overnight at 37\u00b0C and 700\u00a0rpm in a thermomixer using trypsin (Roche) at a protease\u2010to\u2010protein ratio of 1:50.\nDesalting\nDesalting of peptide mixtures was carried out at room temperature using Sep\u2010Pak cartridges (50\u00a0mg sorbent per cartridge, Waters) and a vacuum manifold according to the manufacturer's instructions. Desalted samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further use.\nhSAX chromatography\nFor hydrophilic strong anion exchange (hSAX) chromatography, peptide solutions were first dried down in a Speed\u2010Vac, re\u2010solubilised in hSAX solvent A (5\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.5) to a concentration of 2.73\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcl peptide and then centrifuged for 30\u00a0s at 5,000\u00a0\u00d7g to spin down insoluble debris. Chromatography was carried out using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Thermo Fisher), which was equipped with an IonPac AG24 guard column (Thermo Fisher), as well as an IonPac AS24 strong anion exchange column (Thermo Fisher). Chromatography was performed at 30\u00b0C and a flow rate of 250\u00a0\u03bcl/min. Following the injection of 100\u00a0\u03bcl sample and 3\u00a0min of equilibration with 100% hSAX solvent A, peptides were eluted using a two\u2010step linear gradient from 0 to 25% hSAX solvent B (5\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.5, 1\u00a0M NaCl) in 24\u00a0min and from 25 to 100% solvent B in 13\u00a0min. Solvent B was kept at 100% for another 4\u00a0min to flush the column before returning to 0% in 1\u00a0min and additional 5\u00a0min of equilibration with 100% hSAX solvent A. We started collecting 48 fractions of 250\u00a0\u03bcl after 2\u00a0min of gradient time, which were subsequently combined to form 24 fractions after consulting the 214\u2010nm chromatography trace. For that, fractions 5\u20137 were pooled to form fraction 5, fractions 24\u201325 formed fraction 22, fractions 26\u201328 formed fraction 23 and fractions 29\u201348 formed fraction 24, respectively.\nPost\u2010hSAX desalting\nAll 24 fractions were desalted using StageTips as described earlier (Rappsilber et\u00a0al, 2007), with minor modifications. Briefly, we used five C18 discs (3M Empore) of about 1.5\u00a0mm diameter in 200\u2010\u03bcl pipette tips. After wetting (MeOH followed by 5% TFA in 80% ACN) and equilibration of stage tips (0.1% TFA), acidified samples (pH 2) were loaded twice onto the StageTips to ensure proper binding. Following two washes with 0.1% TFA, samples were eluted using 200\u00a0\u03bcl 0.1% TFA in 60% ACN. Eluates were transferred to 96\u2010well plates, evaporated to dryness using a Speed\u2010Vac and subsequently stored at \u221220\u00b0C until further use.\nKinobeads\nKinobeads gamma (KB\u03b3) pulldowns (biological triplicates) were performed in 96\u2010well filter plates (Porvair Sciences) as described elsewhere (Medard et\u00a0al, 2015), with minor modifications. For each pulldown, 3\u00a0ml of 2.2\u00a0mg/ml TCL was cleared by ultracentrifugation at 167,000\u00a0\u00d7g and 4\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min. Following washing (CP buffer: 50\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1\u00a0mM Na3VO4) and equilibration (CP buffer supplemented with 0.4% Igepal CA\u2010630) of 35\u00a0\u03bcl settled KB\u03b3 per TCL, ~1.8\u00a0ml (equivalent of 4\u00a0mg of protein) of each TCL was transferred to its corresponding well. After 60\u2010min incubation at 4\u00b0C on a head\u2010over\u2010end shaker, the beads were washed thrice with CP buffer containing 0.4% Igepal CA\u2010630 and twice with CP buffer containing 0.2% Igepal CA\u2010630. Subsequently, proteins were eluted by incubating the beads for 30\u00a0min at 50\u00b0C and 700\u00a0rpm in a thermomixer with 60\u00a0\u03bcl of 2\u00d7 NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Thermo Fisher) per well. After collecting eluates by centrifugation, samples were alkylated using 55\u00a0mM chloroacetamide. Finally, detergents and salts were removed from samples by running a short electrophoresis (~0.5\u00a0cm) using 4\u221212% NuPAGE gels (Thermo Fisher), followed by tryptic in\u2010gel digestion according to the standard procedures.\nLC\u2010MS/MS data acquisition\nFull proteomes\nReverse\u2010phase gradient\nFull proteome fractions were measured using nanoflow LC\u2010MS/MS by directly coupling an Eksigent nanoLC\u2010Ultra 1D+ (Eksigent) to an Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). Peptides were dissolved in 20\u00a0\u03bcl buffer A (0.1% FA), injecting 5\u00a0\u03bcl per measurement. Using a flow rate of 5\u00a0\u03bcl/min, peptides were then loaded onto a 2\u2010cm trap column (100\u00a0\u03bcm i.d., ReproSil\u2010Pur 120 ODS\u20103 5\u00a0\u03bcm, Dr. Maisch) and washed for 10\u00a0min with 100% buffer A. Subsequently, peptides were separated on a 40\u2010cm analytical column (75\u00a0\u03bcm i.d., ReproSil\u2010Gold 120 C18 3\u00a0\u03bcm, Dr. Maisch) using a flow rate of 300\u00a0nl/min and a gradient from 2% buffer B (0.1% FA and 5% DMSO in ACN) to 4% in 2\u00a0min (buffer A now also contained 5% DMSO) and from 4 to 32% in 96\u00a0min. Buffer B was then ramped from 32 to 80% in 1\u00a0min and the column was flushed with 80% buffer B for 4\u00a0min, before returning to 2% buffer B in 2\u00a0min and a final equilibration step with 2% buffer B for 5\u00a0min. This resulted in a turnaround time of 120\u00a0min per full proteome fraction, totalling 130\u00a0days of measurement time for the entire CRC65 cell line panel.\nAcquisition parameters\nThe eluate from the analytical column was sprayed via stainless steel emitters (Thermo) at a source voltage of 2.6\u00a0kV towards the orifice of the mass spectrometer; a transfer capillary heated to 275\u00b0C. The Orbitrap Velos was set to data\u2010dependent acquisition in positive ion mode, automatically selecting the top 10\u00a0most intense precursor ions from the preceding full MS (MS1) spectrum with an isolation width of 2.0 Th for fragmentation using higher\u2010energy collisional dissociation (HCD) at 30% normalised collision energy and subsequent identification by MS/MS (MS2). MS1 (360\u20131,300 m/z) and MS2 (precursor\u2010dependent m/z range, starting at m/z 100) spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap using a resolution of 30,000 and 7,500 at m/z 400, with an automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 and 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 charges and a maximum injection time of 100 and 200\u00a0ms, respectively. Dynamic exclusion was set to 60\u00a0s.\nKinobeads\nReverse\u2010phase gradient\nKinobeads eluates were measured using nanoflow LC\u2010MS/MS by directly coupling an Eksigent nanoLC\u2010Ultra 1D+ (Eksigent) to an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). Chromatography as well as data acquisition was similar to the settings used for full proteome fractions; hence, we only describe differences between the two set\u2010ups. We injected 10\u00a0\u03bcl per measurement instead of 5\u00a0\u03bcl and used a slightly steeper gradient from 2% buffer B to 4% in 2\u00a0min and from 4 to 32% in 88\u00a0min instead of 96\u00a0min. The rest of the gradient was kept the same, resulting in a turnaround time of 110\u00a0min per Kinobeads pulldown, totalling ~15\u00a0days of measurement time for the entire CRC65 cell line panel in biological triplicates.\nAcquisition parameters\nThe source voltage was at 2.2\u00a0kV instead of 2.6\u00a0kV and the Orbitrap Elite selected the top 15 most intense precursor ions for MS2 instead of the top 10 most intense ones because of its higher scanning speed. While the MS1\u00a0m/z range, resolution, AGC target value and maximum injection time were the same as for the Orbitrap Velos, the Orbitrap Elite acquired MS2 spectra at a resolution of 15,000 at m/z 400 with an AGC target value of 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 charges and a maximum injection time of 100\u00a0ms. Dynamic exclusion was set to 20\u00a0s instead of 60\u00a0s and the Orbitrap Elite also made use of a global kinase peptide inclusion list, which contained precursor ions and retention times from frequently observed kinase peptides.\nProcessing of LC\u2010MS/MS raw data\nFull proteomes and CPTAC patient data\nMaxQuant v.1.5.3.30 (Cox & Mann, 2008) was used to search our LC\u2010MS/MS raw data, as well as the raw data from the original CPTAC publication on human colon and rectal cancer (Zhang et\u00a0al, 2014) against the UniProtKB human reference proteome (v25.11.2015; 92,011 sequences), concatenated with a list of common contaminants supplied by MaxQuant (245 sequences) in two separate runs with identical settings. Therefore, some data used in this publication were generated by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (NCI/NIH). We set the digestion mode to fully tryptic, allowing for cleavage before proline (Trypsin/P) and a maximum of two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionines and acetylation of protein N\u2010termini were set as variable modifications, allowing for a maximum number of five modifications per peptide. Candidate peptides were required to have a length of at least seven amino acids, with a maximum peptide mass of 4,600\u00a0Da. The fragment ion tolerance was set to 20\u00a0ppm for FTMS (CRC65) and 0.4\u00a0Da for ITMS spectra (CPTAC), respectively. A first search with a precursor ion tolerance of 20\u00a0ppm was used to recalibrate raw data based on all peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) without filtering using hard score cut\u2010offs. After recalibration, the data were searched with a precursor ion tolerance of 4.5\u00a0ppm, while chimeric spectra were searched a second time using MaxQuant's \u201cSecond peptides\u201d option to identify co\u2010fragmented peptide precursors. We used \u201cMatch between runs\u201d with an alignment time window of 30\u00a0min and a match time window of 1.1\u00a0min to transfer identifications between raw files of the same and neighbouring fractions (\u00b1\u00a01 fraction). Using the classical target\u2010decoy approach with a concatenated database of reversed peptide sequences, data were filtered using a PSM and protein false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. Protein groups were required to have at least one unique or razor peptide, with each razor peptide being used only once during the calculation of the protein FDR. No score cut\u2010offs were applied in addition to the target\u2010decoy FDR.\nKinobeads\nRaw files from triplicate Kinobeads pulldowns were processed using a pipeline similar to the one employed for the analysis of full proteomes, adapting some of the parameters described hereafter. The fragment ion tolerance was set to 120\u00a0ppm for FTMS spectra instead of 20\u00a0ppm, since we observed systematic fragment mass deviations, which were linearly dependent on the m/z of the fragment ions in ppm space. Because this was likely due to problems during data acquisition, we had to compensate for it during the processing of raw data. Since Kinobeads pulldowns were not fractionated, \u201cMatch between runs\u201d was used with the same parameters as described above to transfer identifications between all raw files.\nQuantification, statistical analysis and multi\u2010omics data\u00a0integration\nProteins detected in proteomics experiments were quantified based on MaxQuant output data, which was subsequently integrated with transcriptomics data from various CRC samples (see Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods for details). All statistical analyses were carried out using R v3.2.4 (R Core Team, 2016).\nCode availability\nModified MComBat and computeAUC functions (Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods) can be downloaded from https://github.com/mfrejno/pharmacoproteomics_crc.\nData availability\nThe proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository (Vizcaino et\u00a0al, 2016) under ID codes PXD005353\u2013PXD005355.",
