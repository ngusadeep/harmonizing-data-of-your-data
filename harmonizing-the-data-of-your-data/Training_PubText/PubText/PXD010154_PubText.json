    "TITLE": "A deep proteome and transcriptome abundance atlas of 29 healthy human tissues",
    "ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nGenome\u2010, transcriptome\u2010 and proteome\u2010wide measurements provide insights into how biological systems are regulated. However, fundamental aspects relating to which human proteins exist, where they are expressed and in which quantities are not fully understood. Therefore, we generated a quantitative proteome and transcriptome abundance atlas of 29 paired healthy human tissues from the Human Protein Atlas project representing human genes by 18,072 transcripts and 13,640 proteins including 37 without prior protein\u2010level evidence. The analysis revealed that hundreds of proteins, particularly in testis, could not be detected even for highly expressed mRNAs, that few proteins show tissue\u2010specific expression, that strong differences between mRNA and protein quantities within and across tissues exist and that protein expression is often more stable across tissues than that of transcripts. Only 238 of 9,848 amino acid variants found by exome sequencing could be confidently detected at the protein level showing that proteogenomics remains challenging, needs better computational methods and requires rigorous validation. Many uses of this resource can be envisaged including the study of gene/protein expression regulation and biomarker specificity evaluation.",
    "INTRO": "Introduction\nDelineating the factors that govern protein expression and activity in cells is among the most fundamental research topics in biology. Although the number of potential protein\u2010coding genes in the human genome is stabilizing at about 20,000, high\u2010quality evidence for their physical existence has not yet been found for all and intense efforts are ongoing to identify these currently ~13% \u201cmissing proteins\u201d (Omenn et\u00a0al, 2017). While it is also generally accepted that the quantities of proteins vary greatly within and across different cell types, tissues and body fluids (Kim et\u00a0al, 2014; Wilhelm et\u00a0al, 2014), this has not been analysed systematically for many human tissues. Furthermore, it is not very clear yet how the many anabolic and catabolic processes are coordinated to give rise to the often vast differences in the levels of proteins. Messenger RNA levels are important determinants for protein abundance (Vogel et\u00a0al, 2010; Schwanh\u00e4usser et\u00a0al, 2011), and extensive mRNA expression maps of human cell types and tissues have been generated as proxies for estimating protein abundance (GTEx Consortium, 2013; Uhl\u00e9n et\u00a0al, 2015; Thul et\u00a0al, 2017). However, other studies have also highlighted the much higher dynamic range of protein than transcript abundance as well as a rather poor correlation of mRNA and protein levels suggesting that further and possibly diverse regulatory elements play important roles (Schwanh\u00e4usser et\u00a0al, 2011; Liu et\u00a0al, 2016; Franks et\u00a0al, 2017). Decades of careful research revealed numerous mRNA elements affecting translation or mRNA stability such as codon usage, start codon context or secondary structure to name a few. However, most of these studies focussed on single or few genes or single cell types or were performed in model organisms distinct from human systems and often did not cover a lot of proteins. Broader scale analyses have more recently become possible owing to advances in proteome and transcriptome profiling technologies, but these have mostly focussed on a single (disease) tissue or the cell\u2010type resolved analysis of protein expression in single tissues (Zhang et\u00a0al, 2014; Mertins et\u00a0al, 2016). To the best of our knowledge, no broad\u2010scale quantitative and integrative analysis of transcriptomes and proteomes across many healthy human tissues has been performed yet that would enable a comprehensive analysis of factors explaining the experimentally observed differences between mRNA and protein expression. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to generate a resource of molecular profiling data at the mRNA and protein level to facilitate the study of protein expression control and proteogenomics in humans. To this end, we analysed 29 major histologically healthy human tissues from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) project (Uhl\u00e9n et\u00a0al, 2015) to provide a comprehensive baseline map of protein expression across the human body. As we show below as well as in Eraslan et\u00a0al, 2019, these data can be used in many ways to explore protein expression and its regulation in humans. To facilitate further research on this fundamentally important topic and the many further uses that can be envisaged, all data are available in ArrayExpress (Kolesnikov et\u00a0al, 2015) and proteomeXchange (Vizca\u00edno et\u00a0al, 2014).",
    "RESULTS": "Results and Discussion\nComprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of 29 human tissues\nWe analysed 29 histologically healthy tissue specimen representing major human organs by label\u2010free quantitative proteomics and RNA\u2010Seq (Fig\u00a01A; see Appendix\u00a0Figs S1\u2013S6 for the assessment of data quality). Tissues were collected by the HPA project (Fagerberg et\u00a0al, 2014), and adjacent cryosections were used for paired (allele\u2010specific) transcriptome and proteome analysis. RNA\u2010Seq profiling detected and quantified in total 18,072 protein\u2010coding genes with an average of 12,262 (\u00b1\u00a01,007 standard deviation, SD) genes per tissue (Fig\u00a01B) when using a cut\u2010off of 1 fragment per kilobase million (FPKM; Uhl\u00e9n et\u00a0al, 2015). Proteomic profiling by mass spectrometry resulted in the identification and intensity\u2010based absolute quantification (iBAQ; Schwanh\u00e4usser et\u00a0al, 2011) of a total of 15,210 protein groups with an average of 11,005 (\u00b1\u00a0680 SD) protein groups per tissue at a false discovery rate (FDR) of <\u00a01% at the protein, peptide and peptide\u2010spectrum match (PSM) level (Fig\u00a0EV1A). Protein identification was based on 277,698 non\u2010redundant tryptic peptides, representing a total of 13,640 genes and, on average, 10,541 (\u00b1\u00a0512 SD) genes per tissue covering, on average, 86% of the expressed genome in every tissue. While the total number of confidently identified proteins in this study is smaller than that of other (community\u2010based) resources such as ProteomicsDB (Schmidt et\u00a0al, 2018) and neXtProt (Gaudet et\u00a0al, 2017; coverage of 15,721 and 17,470 protein\u2010coding genes, respectively), it provides a highly consistent collection of tissue proteomes including the deepest proteomes to date for many of the tissues analysed. It also provides protein\u2010level evidence for 37 proteins (represented by at least one unique peptide) that are not yet covered by neXtProt (release 2018\u201001\u201017; Table\u00a0EV1). These proteins were validated by synthetic peptides (see PRIDE submission for mirror spectra). Eighteen of these 37 have antibody staining in the current release of the HPA project and all of them show signal in the same tissue they were detected in by MS. This corroborates the detection of these new proteins by an independent method. Eight of these proteins also meet the guidelines of the Human Proteome Project that require \u2265\u00a02 peptides for a new protein each with \u2265\u00a09 amino acids in length (Deutsch et\u00a0al, 2016). We note that the HPP guidelines use reasonable but ad hoc criteria which are likely too conservative and therefore likely discriminate against further genuine cases. Comparing spectra of endogenous to synthetic peptides is likely the more objective criterion which is why we added mirror plots of all evaluated cases to PRIDE (Zolg et\u00a0al, 2017). The expression levels of the \u201cnew\u201d proteins were about a factor 10 below median (iBAQ at log10 scale, 7.4 versus 8.3) which explains why they may have been missed before. Interestingly, 15 of these proteins were detected in the fallopian tube, an organ that has not yet been extensively profiled by proteomics.\nOverall, 13,413 protein\u2010coding genes were detected on both transcript and protein levels, and the detected proteins spanned almost the entire range of mRNA expression again indicating very substantial coverage of the expressed proteome (Fig\u00a01C). However, some proteins could not be detected even for highly expressed mRNAs (i.e. higher than the mean mRNA abundance). About 1/3 of these mRNAs were found in testis (478 of 1,408) and no other tissue contained nearly as many highly expressed mRNAs without protein evidence (Fig\u00a0EV1B). The \u201cmissing\u201d proteins in the testis were statistically significantly enriched for processes related to spermatogenesis by gene ontology analysis (clusterProfiler; n\u00a0=\u00a082 genes; BH\u2010adjusted P\u00a0=\u00a08\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221214). Although the rich expression of mRNAs in testis has been known for a long time and exploited for, e.g., the cloning of many genes from cDNAs, the apparent absence of so many testis proteins with high mRNA expression is surprising. This was not due to, e.g., poor coverage of the testis proteome (11,024 detected protein\u2010coding genes) or other obvious technical factors (such as inefficient extraction of membrane proteins or difficulties with identifying small proteins) that would prevent detection of these proteins. Interestingly, almost 300 of these \u201cmissing\u201d proteins have also not been detected by antibodies in testis (according to HPA) and nearly 200 have no ascribed molecular function. The inability to detect these proteins by mass spectrometry or antibodies despite high levels of mRNA poses a number of questions. For example, are these proteins rapidly degraded implying specialized (and perhaps transient) functions in testis or sperm functionality? Are they perhaps stabilized in response to egg fertilization? Proteins missing at the lower end of the mRNA expression range (less than mean mRNA abundance) are overrepresented in G\u2010protein\u2010coupled receptor activity (n\u00a0=\u00a0173; BH\u2010adjusted P\u00a0=\u00a08.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221250), ion channels (n\u00a0=\u00a0109; BH\u2010adjusted P\u00a0=\u00a07\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210) and cytokine\u2010related biology (n\u00a0=\u00a076; BH\u2010adjusted P\u00a0=\u00a06\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129). The abundance of these proteins may simply have been below the mass spectrometric detection limit or, as described many times, can be difficult to extract from cells owing to the presence of multi\u2010pass transmembrane domains giving rise to few if any MS\u2010compatible tryptic peptides after digestion.\nTo explore which and how many proteins show a tissue\u2010specific expression profile, we applied the classification scheme of Uhl\u00e9n et\u00a0al (2015, 2016) previously developed for mRNA profiling and which stratifies genes into the five classes \u201ctissue\u2010enriched\u201d (fivefold above any other tissue), \u201cgroup enriched\u201d (fivefold above any group of 2\u20137 tissues), \u201cenhanced\u201d (fivefold above the average of all other tissues), \u201cexpressed in all\u201d (expressed in all tissues) as well as \u201cmixed\u201d genes (which do not match the other categories). Overall, a large fraction of all represented genes was expressed in all tissues: 37% (6,725) at the transcript level and 39% (5,400) at the protein level. However, 43% (7,866) of all transcripts and 53% (7,244) of all proteins showed elevated expression in one or more tissues (\u201ctissue\u2010enriched\u201d, \u201cgroup\u2010enriched\u201d or \u201ctissue\u2010enhanced\u201d). Only 0.73% (on average) of all transcripts and 0.65% of all proteins showed a tissue\u2010enriched profile. Two notable exceptions are brain and testis which exhibit a higher percentage of tissue\u2010enriched proteins and transcripts in line with a recent analysis of RNA\u2010Seq data from the HPA and GTEx projects (GTEx Consortium, 2013). Proteins with more tissue\u2010restricted expression tended to be of slightly lower abundance (Fig\u00a0EV1C).\nFor 1,270 of the total 1,998 tissue\u2010enriched proteins detected in our study, antibody staining was available in the HPA. In the 29 tissues that are common between HPA and the current study, 775 proteins were detected in the same tissue lending support to the mass spectrometry\u2010based data presented here. In addition, we compared our tissue\u2010enriched expression data to the targeted MS (PRM) data acquired for about 52 proteins by Edfors et\u00a0al (2016) and 10 tissues that overlapped with our tissue panel (see Appendix\u00a0Figs S7\u2013S9). Incidentally, the Edfors\u2019 study had data on three tissue\u2010enriched proteins. First, myoglobin (MB) was highly tissue\u2010enriched in our data in the heart which was confirmed by the PRM analysis as well as antibody staining in HPA. Second, the protein PDK1 (3\u2010phosphoinositide\u2010dependent protein kinase\u20101) was also found to be a heart\u2010enriched protein and the PRM data confirmed this. This protein was detected in all tissues by antibody staining but we note that immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains are not quantitative so it is difficult to conclude if broad detection of this protein was due to overstaining or poor antibody specificity. The third example is the protein CANT1 (soluble calcium\u2010activated nucleotidase 1) which we detected as a prostate\u2010enriched protein. Again, this was confirmed by the PRM measurement but was again detected in most tissues by IHC.\nThe above global trends in transcript and protein tissue expression distributions were also mirrored by functional categories of genes but with some interesting detail (Fig\u00a01D, Table\u00a0EV4). For example, while the tissue distribution of expression of disease\u2010associated genes followed that of all genes, the expression of drug targets in general and GPCRs in particular was much more tissue\u2010restricted speaking to the notion that proteins may make for better drug targets if they are not ubiquitously expressed (Hao & Tatonetti, 2016). In this context, we point out that our baseline map of protein expression across the human body may be of general value for drug discovery as one can, e.g., quickly examine the expression profile of a particular target of interest, to help better understand adverse clinical effects and off\u2010target mechanisms of action of drugs. For instance, a recent study revealed phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) as an off\u2010target of the pan\u2010HDAC inhibitor panobinostat (Becher et\u00a0al, 2016). Our map of protein expression shows that PAH is abundantly expressed in liver (and kidney) which is also the major site of hydroxylation in the human body (Matthews, 2007), indicating that the liver is the major site where panobinostat exerts its detrimental effects, i.e. leading to decreased tyrosine levels, and eventually hypothyroidism in affected patients. In contrast, essential genes (Blomen et\u00a0al, 2015; Hart et\u00a0al, 2015; Wang et\u00a0al, 2015) as well as mitochondrial genes were found in the vast majority of all tissues in line with their central roles for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Despite the differences in detail, our dataset confirms, at the protein level, that there is a core set of ubiquitously expressed genes/proteins and that individual tissues are not strongly characterized by the categorical presence or absence of mRNAs or proteins but rather by quantitative differences (Geiger et\u00a0al, 2013). This is also evident from an analysis of the most divergently expressed proteins or transcripts that shows enrichment of proteins related to the functional specialization of the respective tissue (Fig\u00a0EV1D, Table\u00a0EV3).\nmRNA and protein expression\nThe relationship between mRNA and protein expression has been studied extensively over the past years and there continues to be debate in terms of how the various correlations that can be computed may be interpreted in terms of technical artefacts or biological meaning (Liu et\u00a0al, 2016; Fortelny et\u00a0al, 2017; Franks et\u00a0al, 2017; Wilhelm et\u00a0al, 2017). While it is beyond the scope of the current study to attempt to reconcile the different views, the extensive data on both mRNA and protein expression provided in this resource should help to eventually bring clarity. Therefore, in the following, we confine our analysis of the expression data to a few basic points we nonetheless deem important.\nThe dynamic range of transcripts detected by RNA\u2010Seq spanned about four orders of magnitude and that of proteins detected by mass spectrometry spanned eight orders of magnitude (Fig\u00a02A; see Appendix\u00a0Fig 10 for the corresponding plot using copy numbers that show essentially the same characteristics; Table\u00a0EV5). This difference alone explains (at least in part) the overall higher coverage of the expressed proteome by RNA\u2010Seq compared to that of LC\u2010MS/MS. This is because there is limited \u201csequencing capacity\u201d particularly in mass spectrometry. Thus, detecting very low\u2010abundance molecules will be harder, the wider the dynamic range of expression and the lower the sampling depth is. For example, the (paired\u2010end) RNA data provided (on average) 18\u00a0M reads per tissue. Those 18\u00a0M reads are distributed across 4 orders of magnitude of abundance with an inevitable bias to the higher abundant transcripts. The MS data only provided (on average) ~76,000 peptides and ~284,000 identified tandem mass spectra (peptide to spectrum matches; PSMs) per tissue and these are distributed over eight orders of magnitude also with a bias for the more abundant proteins. As a result, it is currently much easier to cover many genes by RNA\u2010Seq than it is to cover the same number by LC\u2010MS/MS.\nAs noted before, the much wider dynamic range at the protein level implies that protein synthesis and protein stability play an important role in determining protein levels beyond mRNA levels (Schwanh\u00e4usser et\u00a0al, 2011; Vogel & Marcotte, 2012). Similarly, the number of protein molecules produced per molecule of mRNA appears to be much larger for high\u2010 than for low\u2010abundance transcripts, leading to a nearly quadratic relationship between mRNA levels and protein levels in every tissue (slope of 2.6 in Fig\u00a02B for brain and between 1.8 and 2.7 for all 29 tissues, Fig\u00a0EV2A; Appendix\u00a0Fig S11). While this observation has been made before in yeast (Cs\u00e1rdi et\u00a0al, 2015), this study shows that it is a general phenomenon. The effect may be rationalized by cellular economics such that genes encoding highly abundant proteins not only express high mRNAs levels, but also encode regulatory elements that favour high translation efficiency and high protein stability (Vogel et\u00a0al, 2010). The often vast differences in mRNA and protein expression within a tissue can also be visualized by plotting the ranked order of relative intensities of transcripts and proteins (Fig\u00a02C, Appendix\u00a0Fig S12). For example, in the heart (an extreme case), 41% of the total mRNA quantity (by FPKM) represents a single protein (MT\u2010ATP8) and nearly 60% of the total mRNA covers just five transcripts (all coding for mitochondrial proteins). In contrast, about 13% of the total protein quantity (by iBAQ) is contributed by five proteins (four of which are myosins and one represents a \u201ccontamination\u201d from blood present in the tissue). One would expect the heart to be rich in both protein families owing to the contractile function of the organ which requires a lot of energy. While it is possible that some of the mitochondrial proteins are underrepresented in quantitative terms (because, e.g., MT\u2010ATP8 is a very small protein (7\u00a0kDa) and its iBAQ value may therefore not reflect its true quantity or because our lysis conditions may not have solubilized this organelle with high efficiency), it is surprising that even among the 100 most highly expressed mRNAs and proteins, only about 20% are the same (Fig\u00a02D). This overlap only increases to about 60% for the 5,000 most abundant proteins and transcripts (Fig\u00a0EV2B). The above reflects why RNA\u2013protein abundance plots generally show only modest correlation. The above rank order lists of transcripts and proteins are also quite different between tissues with the spleen showing the opposite characteristics compared to the heart, and the lung showing a more even distribution of transcript and protein levels (Fig\u00a0EV2C and D).\nWe find that many proteins are often expressed at broadly similar levels across human tissues (say within a factor 10; Fig\u00a0EV2E). It is, therefore, not very surprising that the correlation of mRNA/protein ratios across tissues is generally not very strong (Fig\u00a02E; median 0.35). Still, there is positive correlation in ~90% of all cases and almost half are also statistically significant. This distribution is not affected by requiring detection of a protein in 10, 20 or all 29 tissues (see Appendix\u00a0Figs S13\u2013S15). However, great care has to be taken when interpreting such distributions. As shown in Fig\u00a02F, the transcript and protein levels of the tyrosine kinase SYK span an expression range of 45\u2010fold and 39\u2010fold, respectively (natural scale), and are highly correlated across tissues reflecting the specialized function of the protein in T\u2010 and B\u2010cell biology. In contrast, RNA and protein expression of EIF4A3 (a DEAD\u2010box RNA helicase involved in translation initiation) only spanned sixfold and 11\u2010fold between tissues and showed no correlation. We note that cases such as the latter are merely the result of technical variation in the measurement or genuinely similar expression levels in most tissues reflecting the roles of these proteins in central biological processes in all tissues (Appendix\u00a0Fig S16; Wilhelm et\u00a0al, 2017).\nIt is noteworthy that proteomes correlate stronger between tissues (median of 0.77) than transcriptomes (median of 0.67; Fig\u00a03A; see Appendix\u00a0Fig S17). It is possible that, because of the fact that the dynamic range of protein levels is larger than that of RNA, small biological or technical variations of individual genes may or may not have impact on the overall rankings (Fortelny et\u00a0al, 2017; Franks et\u00a0al, 2017). It might, however, also imply that there are (hitherto not very clear) mechanisms in cells that \u201cbuffer\u201d the protein quantities against changes in mRNA abundance (Liu et\u00a0al, 2016; Kustatscher et\u00a0al, 2017). The strongest correlations for both transcripts and proteins were found for the anatomically adjacent small intestine and duodenum. At the proteome level, the brain showed clear differences to other proteomes and gastrointestinal organs appear to be more similar to each other. Visualizing the transcriptome and proteome profiles in a plane using co\u2010inertia analysis (CIA; Culhane et\u00a0al, 2005) indicate that mRNA and protein levels are more similar to each other within tissues than between tissues (Fig\u00a03B) also reflected by an RV coefficient of 0.77 (a multivariate generalization of the squared Pearson correlation coefficient). Moreover, the CIA grouped several tissues according to similarities in their physiological function with tissues of the immune system and of the gastrointestinal tract representing the largest groups. It is interesting to note that this clustering appears to be driven by the cellular composition of individual tissues (Table\u00a0EV6). For instance, the appendix co\u2010clusters with the spleen, lymph node and tonsil and all four tissues contain a large fraction of lymphocytes (Fig\u00a03C, blue panel). Similarly, the duodenum and small intestine comprise a large proportion of (intestinal) glandular cells, which are important determinants of the molecular make\u2010up of those tissues (Fig\u00a03C, grey panel). All the above illustrates that there must be multiple molecular factors and mechanisms determining the quantitative expression of proteins. This particular aspect of the present mRNA/protein expression resource may be particularly useful for the community as it provides a rich data source for the study of protein expression control (see also Eraslan et\u00a0al, 2019).\nProteogenomic characterization of human tissues\nOne aspect of the data we cover in more detail in this study is the considerable interest in the community to use proteomics data to annotate genomes, often referred to as proteogenomics. With matched RNA\u2010Seq and proteomics data at hand, we set out to assess the merits of proteogenomics at several levels. First, we investigated the identification of protein isoforms. Based on RNA\u2010Seq data, it has been suggested that human cell types typically express one dominant isoform (Gonz\u00e0lez\u2010Porta et\u00a0al, 2013; Ezkurdia et\u00a0al, 2015). In proteomics, isoforms are often more difficult to distinguish because the identification of proteins is inferred from the underlying peptide data. Given that many proteins contain conserved stretches of amino acids and the fact that the median sequence coverage achieved for each protein is limited (here between 14 and 25%; Fig\u00a0EV3A), many potential isoforms may not be covered by unique peptides and some peptides may also match to multiple entries in comprehensive sequence collections such as Ensembl (102,450 entries). This often leads to the identification of a so\u2010called protein group rather than one specific protein or isoform thereof. Illustrated by the proteomic data obtained from trypsin\u2010digested tonsil (Fig\u00a04A), only 14% of all protein groups contained one single protein when searching the MS data against Ensembl. However, when searching the same data against a protein sequence database constructed from the tissue\u2010specific RNA\u2010Seq data, the proportion of single entry protein groups increased to 53% (see Appendix\u00a0Fig S18 for all tissues). In this way, we were able to identify 60,519 non\u2010redundant isoforms by RNA\u2010Seq for 18,072 genes and confirm 15,257 by proteomics for 11,833 genes across the 29 tissues (Fig\u00a0EV3B, Tables EV2 and EV8). The same analysis also showed that there were rather few proteins that were detected with more than one isoform in the tonsil tissue (see Appendix\u00a0Fig S19).\nOne way to improve the detection of isoforms is to increase the sequence coverage in the proteomic data. To this end, we performed an ultra\u2010deep proteomic analysis of tonsil tissue by applying seven different proteases (trypsin, LysC, LysN, GluC, ArgC, AspN and chymotrypsin) and three peptide fragmentation techniques (HCD, CID and EThcD/ETD). This resulted in the identification of 11,569 protein groups (10,288 genes), represented by 421,073 non\u2010redundant peptides leading to a median protein sequence coverage of 54% (Fig\u00a0EV3C\u2013E; Table\u00a0EV7) when searched against Ensembl. Of these protein groups, 2,201 could be unambiguously linked to a single isoform. When searched against protein sequences derived from the tonsil\u2010specific RNA\u2010Seq data, we identified 10,592 protein groups, among which 6,293 represented a particular isoform identified by unique peptides (Fig\u00a04A; Table\u00a0EV7). The above shows that isoform calling on the protein level is indeed quite successful particularly when matched RNA\u2010Seq data are available. We note though that because most isoforms were detected by very few isoform\u2010unique peptides, confident quantification of the different isoforms of the same gene found in the same tissue can be difficult and may require targeted MS assays rather than shotgun approaches to be accurate. In this context, it is also worth mentioning that there is no clear consensus in the proteomics and transcriptomics communities as to how quantitative values should be allocated to particular proteins or transcripts. While it is custom in proteomics to use the parsimonious approach (i.e. allocate all iBAQ intensity to the protein with the highest overall evidence), it is custom to distribute RNA\u2010Seq reads covering shared sequences across multiple transcripts containing that sequence (Trapnell et\u00a0al, 2010). Unfortunately, there is currently no software available that would enable the systematic analysis of using either approach for both types of data. This should be attempted in the future because it would not be surprising if these differences in quantification approaches would add substantially to the poor correlation of mRNA and protein levels (or their ratios). In addition, there is currently no tractable way to determine which allele of a gene gave rise to a detected protein or isoform thereof.\nTo assess the ability of proteomics to detect genetic variants such as single amino acid variants (SAAV), we generated whole exome sequencing (WES), RNA\u2010Seq and ultra\u2010deep proteomics data for tonsil tissue. In the WES data, the average exon coverage was 98\u00d7 and 97% of the exons were covered >\u00a020\u00d7 providing a sound basis for the identification of SAAVs. Variant calling and filtering of WES data resulted in 9,848 high\u2010quality, non\u2010synonymous point mutations (i.e. nonsense and missense variants excluding I\u00a0>\u00a0L and L\u00a0>\u00a0I variants that cannot be distinguished by mass spectrometry), representing 5,527 human genes and including 6,112 heterozygous and 3,736 homozygous variants (Fig\u00a04B, Table\u00a0EV8). In the RNA\u2010Seq data, 3,524 of the 9,848 genomic variants (36%; 2,171 heterozygous and 1,353 homozygous cases; representing 2,428 genes) were covered sufficiently (\u2265\u00a010\u00d7) to assess their genotype. The reason for the substantial loss of coverage in the RNA\u2010Seq versus exome data is because (i) not all genes are expressed from both alleles in a given tissue and (ii) even at a sequencing depth of 18\u00a0million reads, the dynamic range of mRNA abundance is too high to cover all transcripts and variants many times over.\nIt has been noted before that the identification of SAAVs by proteomics is challenging and plagued by false positives in standard database searching regimen because (i) the tandem mass spectra used for database searching are often not of very high quality, (ii) these spectra often do not contain the complete amino acid sequence information of the underlying peptide and (iii) the current FDR statistics for peptide/protein identification do not translate well to variant calling on the peptide level. As a result, random matches can and will frequently occur raising substantial concern about the quality of part of the current proteogenomic literature (Nesvizhskii, 2014). When searching our proteomic data against concatenated sequences obtained from the WES data, Ensembl and UniProt and requiring an identification by both Mascot and Andromeda as well as a number of further criteria (for details, see methods), we identified 1,942 candidate peptides mapping to 724 of the 9,848 (non\u2010canonical) exome variants (7.4% of total; 400 heterozygous and 324 homozygous cases). These peptide variants are all missense mutations (Table\u00a0EV8). For 41% of the heterozygous cases (165 out of 400), we obtained peptide\u2010level evidence for the canonical and alternative variant, while for the remaining cases, we only identified the alternative variant (235).\nFor validation, candidate peptide spectra were compared to those of synthetic reference standards (Zolg et\u00a0al, 2017). To this end, we attempted the synthesis of reference peptides for all 724 alternative variants and obtained such peptides for 574 cases. Automated spectral angle analysis (Toprak et\u00a0al, 2014) provided evidence for 238 variants (SA \u2265\u00a00.7, Mascot ion score \u2265\u00a050) including 109 heterozygous and 129 homozygous cases (Fig\u00a04B; Table\u00a0EV8; see PRIDE for mirror plots). Manual inspection of the above 724 candidate peptides identified 204 unique alternative variant sites of which 158 were also found in the SA analysis. The variants that passed our (conservative) filtering criteria merely represent 2.4% of all variants detected at the exome level, 6.7% of the variants detected at the mRNA level and 32% of the candidates suggested by database searching. When tracing the confidently identified peptide variants back to the proteomic workflow, it became clear that the vast majority of all variants are represented by peptides generated by trypsin, LysC and ArgC cleavage and using the standard HCD fragmentation technique. In addition, the confirmation rate (using the synthetic peptide reference standards) for tryptic peptides was also much higher than that of the other enzymes (Fig\u00a04C; synthetic peptides were not measured by EThcD/ETD). This can be attributed to the fact that trypsin\u2010like peptides generally show well\u2010predictable fragmentation behaviour and that most bioinformatic tools are optimized for use with data generated from tryptic digestion of proteomes.\nWhile the above shows that some of the variants detected on the nucleotide level could be confirmed at the protein level, the overall success rate was low. We note here that this was mainly not due to lack of expression of the underlying gene because the proteomic data cover 76% of all expressed tonsil genes (9,287 of 12,203 mRNA\u2010Seq genes), 48% (2,633 of 5,527) of all the genes for which variants were detected by exome sequencing and 76% (1,836 of 2,428) by RNA\u2010Seq, respectively (further discussed below). Instead, the main reasons for poor coverage of SAAVs at the proteome level are the still limited sensitivity and dynamic range of detection, limited peptide coverage of a protein and the insufficient coverage of amino acids in peptide mass spectra along with shortcomings in peptide identification algorithms. Further reasons include that annotated variants may actually not exist at the protein level (e.g. because of sequencing/calling errors), they may not be translated, they may be rapidly degraded to an extent that they are not detectable at steady state etc. Even for the successful cases, the analysis clearly shows that SAAV detection by proteomics requires very rigorous validation in order to be credible.\nRecent research showed that there is more heterogeneity in gene models than previously anticipated, as a result of, e.g., alternative translation initiation sites (aTIS; Na et\u00a0al, 2018) and there is an ongoing debate in the community whether or not long non\u2010coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can be translated into proteins (Chen et\u00a0al, 2017). Ribosomal profiling showed that thousands of potential aTIS may exist and that ~40% of all lncRNAs can at least engage the ribosome (Kearse & Wilusz, 2017). In order to explore if our resource can provide protein evidence for such cases, we used a database search strategy (Marx et\u00a0al, 2017) in which we queried all LC\u2010MS/MS files against combined sequences from(i) a curated lncRNA database (GENCODE v.25), (ii) a database containing protein sequences derived from alternative translation initiation sites (see Materials and Methods), (iii) GENCODE, (iv) UniProt and (v) the tissue\u2010specific RNA\u2010Seq data. Any potential lncRNA or aTIS peptide was required to originate from one single sequence collection only (i.e. lncRNA or aTIS and no other database), be identified by both Mascot and Andromeda, to fulfil stringent score cut\u2010offs (see Materials and Methods), to be backed up by the expression of the underlying transcript in at least one of the tissues (FPKM >\u00a01) and to fail a BLAST search against UniProt to exclude obvious alternative explanations. This approach yielded 5 lncRNA and 344 aTIS peptides, respectively. Because of the size of the searched database (aTIS: 474,991 entries; lncRNA: 29,524 entries), there was still ample opportunity to generate false positives. Interestingly, not a single lncRNA peptide could be substantiated by synthetic peptides indicating that lncRNA is rarely if at all translated (B\u00e1nfai et\u00a0al, 2012).\nTo validate the candidate aTIS peptides, we compared spectra of endogenous and synthetic peptide reference standards as described above. Only 66 aTIS peptides (including 8\u00a0N\u2010terminally acetylated peptides) covering 53 genes and 57 alternative translation start sites could be confirmed in this way (Table\u00a0EV8). Manual spectrum interpretation yielded 96 aTIS peptides (overlap of 45 to the SA analysis) mapping to 76 genes and 81 alternative translation start sites. In total, we confirmed 117 aTIS peptides mapping to 89 genes and 99 alternative translation start sites, which included 14 peptides from 12 genes reported in previous studies, for example FXR2, RPA1 and CDV3 (Table\u00a0EV8; Branca et\u00a0al, 2014; Kim et\u00a0al, 2014). Fifty\u2010five of the above aTIS peptides represent 5\u2032 N\u2010terminal extensions of the original gene, 32 peptides represent novel (acetylated) N\u2010termini downstream of the canonical start site, 17 represent frame\u2010shifts potentially leading to an entirely new sequence, five peptides likely represent upstream ORFs (uORF) with a stop codon before the canonical start site and 8 peptides with mixed annotation (Fig\u00a04D, left panel). The mirror mass spectra in Fig\u00a04E for the endogenous (top) and synthetic (bottom) peptide (ac)ATTQISKDELDELKEAFAK from the actin\u2010binding protein plastin\u20103 (PLS3) provide an example for the detection of a novel N\u2010terminal sequence. For 36 of the peptides representing aTIS, we identified the exact start site as the peptide was N\u2010terminally acetylated (Fig\u00a04D, right panel). Among these, 18 contained an AUG start codon (Met), 8 contained a GUG start codon (Val), 5 a UUG and 4 a CUG start site (both Leu), and one GCG start site (Ala). This confirms the emerging notion that non\u2010AUG translation initiation events are not as infrequent as previously thought and may represent a mechanism to regulate protein expression (Kearse & Wilusz, 2017). This study only identified a relatively small number of aTIS events compared to others (Na et\u00a0al, 2018) implying that enrichment of N\u2010terminal peptides (Gevaert et\u00a0al, 2003; Kleifeld et\u00a0al, 2010) is a more efficient way to detect such events systematically but also pointing out that the previous literature may not be free of a substantial number of mistakes.\nAn important learning from the present systematic analysis of transcriptomes and proteomes of human tissues is that identifying protein SAAVs or novel coding sequences using proteomics is possible but remains challenging. There were large discrepancies between the results of the two database search engines used (Mascot and Andromeda; Fig\u00a0EV3F and G; Appendix\u00a0Figs S20 and S21) implying that the underlying scoring schemes are not optimized yet for the detection of variants and novel coding regions. At present, synthetic peptide reference spectra appear to be mandatory for validation and manual spectra comparisons still have a role to play (Lee et\u00a0al, 2018). Neither approach has been followed systematically in the literature so far and, obviously, they are also not without error but clearly more powerful than purely relying on statistical criteria with largely arbitrary cut\u2010offs alone (Nesvizhskii, 2014; Dimitrakopoulos et\u00a0al, 2016; Lee et\u00a0al, 2018). It appears that even with the latest proteomic technology, proteogenomics currently offers rather small returns on very significant efforts in data generation, analysis and validation and that large improvements will be required to change this situation substantially in the future. It is possible that our filtering criteria were perhaps too strong so that further variants may be present in the data (see Table\u00a0EV8). However, no convincing false discovery rate estimation has been published yet for spectral angle analysis (let\u00a0alone for manual data analysis); hence, we decided to be conservative. Still, the resource presented in this work should be of considerable value for scientists wishing to develop more sophisticated approaches for proteogenomics in the future and the authors think that there is considerable future potential in the use of synthetic peptide references in conjunction with spectral angle analysis particularly for the many chimeric spectra present in classical data\u2010dependent proteomic datasets but even more so for the increasing application of data\u2010independent data acquisition regimes.",

    "METHODS": "Materials and Methods\nHuman tissue specimen\nThe 29 human tissue samples used for mRNA and protein expression analysis were obtained from the Department of Pathology, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden, as part of the sample collection governed by the Uppsala Biobank (www.uppsalabiobank.uu.se/en/). All tissue samples were collected and handled using standards developed in the Human Protein Atlas (www.proteinatlas.org) and in accordance with Swedish laws and regulations. Tissue samples were anonymized in agreement with approval and advisory reports from the Uppsala Ethical Review Board (References # 2002\u2010577, 2005\u2010338 and 2007\u2010159 (protein) and # 2011\u2010473 (RNA)). The need for informed consent was waived by the ethics committee. The list of all tissues along with corresponding donor information, sample preparation and measurement information is provided in Table\u00a0EV1.\nRNA sequencing\nProcedures for RNA extraction from tissues, library preparation and sequencing have already been described (Uhl\u00e9n et\u00a0al, 2015). Briefly, pieces of frozen human tissue were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Cryosections were cut and stained with haematoxylin\u2010eosin for microscopical confirmation of tissue quality and proper representativity. 5\u201310 cryosections (10\u00a0\u03bcm) were transferred to RNAse\u2010free tubes for extraction of total RNA using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was analysed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system with the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit (Agilent Biotechnologies). Only samples of high\u2010quality RNA (RNA integrity number \u2265\u00a07.5) were used for mRNA sample preparation and sequencing. The mRNA strands were fragmented using Fragmentation Buffer (Illumina), and the templates were used to construct cDNA libraries using a TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). Gene expression was assessed by deep sequencing of cDNA on Illumina HiSeq 2000/2500 system (Illumina) for paired\u2010end reads with a read length of 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100 bases. RNA sequencing data were aligned against the human reference genome (GRCh38, v83) using Tophat2.0.8b. FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads) values were calculated using Cufflinks v2.1.1 as a proxy for transcript expression level. The FPKM values of each gene were summed up in an individual sample, and median normalization was applied to evaluate genes expression levels between tissues. A cut\u2010off value of 1 FPKM was used as a lower limit for detection across all tissues.\nSample preparation and off\u2010line hydrophilic strong anion chromatography (hSAX)\nFresh frozen human tissue samples (parallel cryosections cut simultaneously as those used for RNA extraction, described above) were prepared for LC\u2010MS/MS as described previously (Ruprecht et\u00a0al, 2017). Briefly, tissue slices were homogenized in lysis buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 8\u00a0M urea, 10\u00a0mM tris(2\u2010carboxyethyl)phosphin hydrochloride, 40\u00a0mM chloroacetamide, protease and phosphatase inhibitors) by bead milling (Precellys 24, Bertin Instruments, France; 5,500\u00a0rpm, 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0s, 10\u00a0s pause). Protein content was determined using the Bradford method (Coomassie (Bradford) Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Scientific), and 300\u00a0\u03bcg of the protein extract was used for in\u2010solution digestion with trypsin. For this, the sample was diluted with 50\u00a0mM Tris/HCl to a final urea concentration of 1.6\u00a0M, and trypsin was added at a 50:1 (w/w) protein\u2010to\u2010protease ratio. After 4\u00a0h of digestion at 37\u00b0C, another aliquot of trypsin was added to reach a final 25:1 (w/w) protein\u2010to\u2010protease ratio and the sample was incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. In addition, the tonsil sample was subjected to digestion using LysC, ArgC, GluC, AspN, LysN and chymotrypsin (LysC was from Wako, Japan; the other proteases were from Promega, USA). 300\u00a0\u03bcg of the protein extract prepared as described above was applied in each digestion. The buffers were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocols. The resulting peptides were desalted and concentrated on C18 StageTips (Rappsilber et\u00a0al, 2007) and fractionated via hSAX off\u2010line chromatography exactly as described previously (Ruprecht et\u00a0al, 2017). The details of digestion for each tissue are given in the Appendix\u00a0Table\u00a0S1.\nOn\u2010line liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2010MS/MS)\nQuantitative label\u2010free LC\u2010MS/MS analysis was performed using a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled on\u2010line to a nanoflow LC system (NanoLC\u2010Ultra 1D+, Eksigent, USA). Peptides were delivered to a trap column (0.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0cm, packed with 5\u00a0\u03bcm ReproSil\u2010Pur AQ, Dr. Maisch GmbH, Germany) at a flow rate of 5\u00a0\u03bcl/min for 10\u00a0min in 100% solvent A (0.1% formic acid, FA, in HPLC\u2010grade water). After 10\u00a0min of loading and washing, peptides were transferred to a 40\u00a0cm (75\u2010\u03bcm inner diameter) analytical column, packed with 3\u00a0\u03bcm, ReproSil\u2010Pur C18\u2010AQ, Dr. Maisch GmbH, Germany) and separated using a 110\u2010min gradient from 2% to 32% solvent B (0.1% FA, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide in acetonitrile, ACN) at a flow rate of 300\u00a0nL/min. Full scans (m/z 360\u20131,300) were acquired at a resolution of 70,000 using an AGC target value of 3e6 and a maximum ion injection time of 100\u00a0ms. Internal calibration was performed using the signal of a DMSO cluster as lock mass (Hahne et\u00a0al, 2013). Tandem mass spectra were generated for up to 20 precursors by higher\u2010energy collisional dissociation (HCD) using a normalized collision energy of 25%. The dynamic exclusion was set to 35\u00a0s. Fragment ions were detected at a resolution of 17,500 using an AGC target value of 1e5 and a maximum ion injection time of 50\u00a0ms.\nLysC\u2010, ArgC\u2010, GluC\u2010, AspN\u2010, LysN\u2010 and chymotrypsin\u2010digested samples were measured on a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled on\u2010line to a nanoflow LC system (NanoLC\u2010Ultra 1D+, Eksigent, USA). Full scan MS spectra were acquired at 60,000 resolution and a maximum ion injection time of 25\u00a0ms. Tandem mass spectra were generated for up to 15 peptide precursors and fragments detected at a resolution of 15,000. The MS2 AGC target value was set to 2e5 with a maximum ion injection time of 100\u00a0ms. The other settings were the same as for the Q Exactive Plus.\nTryptic peptides from the tonsil sample were also analysed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled on\u2010line to a nanoflow LC system (UltiMate\u2122 3000 RSLC Nano System, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using CID, and EThcD/ETD fragmentation. Full MS scans were performed at a resolution of 60,000, a maximum injection time of 50\u00a0ms and an AGC target value is 5e5, followed by MS2 events with a duty cycle of 2\u00a0s for the most intense precursors and a dynamic exclusion set to 60\u00a0s. CID scans were acquired with 35% normalized collision energy and Orbitrap readout (1e5 AGC target, 0.25 activation Q, 20\u00a0ms maximum injection time, inject ions for all available parallelizable time enabled, 1.3\u00a0m/z isolation width). EThcD/ETD scans used charge\u2010dependent parameters: 2+ precursor ions were fragmented by EThcD with 28% normalized collision energy and 3+ to 7+ precursor ions were fragmented by ETD. The MS2 scans were read out in the Orbitrap (1e5 AGC target, 0.25 activation Q and 100\u00a0ms maximum injection time).\nMS data processing and database searching\nFor peptide and protein identification and label\u2010free quantification, the MaxQuant suite of tools version 1.5.3.30 was used. The spectra were searched against the Ensembl human proteome database (release\u201083, GRCh38) with carbamidomethyl (C) specified as a fixed modification. Oxidation (M) and acetylation (protein N\u2010Term) were considered as variable modifications. Trypsin/P was specified as the proteolytic enzyme with 2 maximum missed cleavages. The match between runs function was enabled, with match time window set to 0.7\u00a0min and an alignment time window of 20\u00a0min. The FDR was set to 1% at both PSM and protein level. LysC/P, ArgC and LysN were specified with two maximum missed cleavages. Searches for GluC and AspN peptides allowed three missed cleavages. Chymotrypsin (C terminal of F, Y, L, W or M) was allowed with at most 4 missed cleavages. Label\u2010free quantification was performed using the iBAQ approach (Schwanh\u00e4usser et\u00a0al, 2011). For non\u2010tryptic peptides and single tissue analysis, matching data between fractions were disabled.\nQuantitative analysis of transcriptomes and proteomes\nThe quantitative analyses of proteomic and transcriptomic data were performed at the gene level. Since some genes have alternative Ensembl gene IDs with identical sequences, redundant protein sequences derived from these genes exist in protein sequence databases. These alternative gene IDs were not part of the reference sequences for the analysis of RNA\u2010Seq data. To improve comparability between RNA and protein measurements, such identifiers were removed from the MaxQuant output files an updated protein ID and gene ID column was added to Table\u00a0EV1. To evaluate gene expression level, the total abundance of each gene in all individual sample was used. The data were log\u2010transformed (base 10) and normalized using median centring across tissues.\nThe genes were classified into \u201cTissue enriched\u201d, \u201cGroup enriched\u201d, \u201cTissue enhanced\u201d, \u201cExpressed in all\u201d and \u201cMixed\u201d as described by Uhl\u00e9n et\u00a0al (2015, 2016). Gene ontology analysis of genes only identified in transcriptomes and proteomes, and the elevated proteins expressed in each tissue were performed using the R package \u201cclusterProfiler\u201d and P\u2010values were adjusted according to the method by Benjamini\u2013Hochberg (BH; Yu et\u00a0al, 2012). The resulting (redundant) gene ontology terms (biology process) of elevated genes were removed using the \u201csimplify\u201d function in clusterProfiler based on GOSemSim (Yu et\u00a0al, 2010). The list of 1,158 mitochondrial genes was obtained from MitoCarta 2.0 (Calvo et\u00a0al, 2016). Essential genes (n\u00a0=\u00a0583) were assembled from three human essential gene studies using CRISPR\u2010Cas9 and retroviral gene\u2010trap genetic screens (Blomen et\u00a0al, 2015; Hart et\u00a0al, 2015; Wang et\u00a0al, 2015). Diseases\u2010related genes (n\u00a0=\u00a03,896) and kinase genes (n\u00a0=\u00a0504) were obtained from UniProt. Cancer genes (n\u00a0=\u00a0719) were downloaded from Cosmic (Futreal et\u00a0al, 2004). Drug target genes (n\u00a0=\u00a0784) were obtained from DrugBank (Wishart et\u00a0al, 2018) and restricted to proteins directly related to the mechanism of action for at least one of the associated drugs. GPCR genes (n\u00a0=\u00a01,410) were obtained from HGNC, and phosphatase genes (n\u00a0=\u00a0238) were from DEPOD (Duan et\u00a0al, 2015). Transcription factor genes (IF, n\u00a0=\u00a01,639) were obtained from the HumanTFs collection (Lambert et\u00a0al, 2018).\nThe Spearman correlation coefficient was used for correlating transcriptome and proteome levels in single tissues. The slopes were estimated by ranged major\u2010axis (RMA) regression, which allows errors in both variables and is symmetric, using the R package \u201clmodel2\u201d (Cs\u00e1rdi et\u00a0al, 2015). The protein\u2013mRNA Spearman correlation coefficients of 9,870 genes which were at least expressed in 10 (20, 29) tissues at both mRNA and protein levels were calculated. The co\u2010inertia analysis (CIA) was performed using the \u201ccia\u201d function in the \u201cmade4\u201d R package (Culhane et\u00a0al, 2005). A total of 9,870 genes which were expressed in at least 10 tissues at both mRNA and protein levels were considered, and the remaining missing values were replaced with a positive value 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 times smaller than the lowest expression value in each dataset.\nProtein copy numbers were calculated from intensity values according to the \u201cproteomic ruler\u201d approach (Wi\u015bniewski et\u00a0al, 2014). Transcript copy numbers were calculated from FPKM values based on the estimated total cellular RNA amount using the total intensity of ribosomal proteins (Wi\u015bniewski et\u00a0al, 2014) and the assumption that the cellular mRNA mass represents about 2% of the total cellular RNA mass (Melnikov et\u00a0al, 2012).\nConstruction of sample\u2010specific protein sequence databases from RNA\u2010Seq data\nRNA sequencing data were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38, v83) using Tophat2.0.8b. FPKM values were calculated using Cufflinks v2.1.1 as a proxy for transcript expression level. Rvboost was used for variant calling. All transcripts with FPKM >\u00a01 were translated into protein sequences and included in the search database. Each tissue was searched against its matched RNA\u2010Seq database using MaxQuant as described above. The match between runs function was disabled. The MaxQuant output data were used for the isoform analysis.\nExome sequencing and variant calling\nThe exome of tonsil tissue was enriched using the Agilent SureSelectXT Kit (v5) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer. The raw data were aligned to the human reference genome (hg38) using bwa (v0.7.12), and duplicate reads were marked using Picard Tools (v2.4.1). Genomic variants were called and filtered using the GATK (v.3.6) HaplotypeCaller and VariantFiltration modules, respectively, according to the best practice guide (https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/). Furthermore, variants at sites with a read depth <\u00a010\u00d7 were removed. We also removed any I/L variation as these cannot be distinguished by mass spectrometry. The resulting variants were annotated using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (v85). The RNA sequencing data were aligned to the human reference genome (hg38) using STAR aligner (v2.5.2), and duplicate reads were marked using Picard Tools (v2.4.1). Variants were called using the GATK (v.3.6) HaplotypeCaller module, according to the aforementioned best practice guide.\nA variant fasta formatted database was created by the \u201ccustomProDB\u201d package from the exomic variants (Wang & Zhang, 2013). Mascot searching of the ultra\u2010deep mass spectrometry data was performed against this database together with protein databases from UniProt and Ensembl using the following parameters: peptide mass tolerance set at 10\u00a0ppm, MS/MS tolerance set at 0.05\u00a0Da, carbamidomethylation of cysteine defined as fixed modification, oxidation of methionine and acetylation defined as variable modification. Trypsin\u2010, LysC\u2010, ArgC\u2010 and LysN\u2010digested peptides allowed up to two missed cleavages. AspN\u2010 and GluC (V8\u2010DE in Mascot search engine)\u2010digested peptides with up to three cleavages were considered. Chymotrypsin\u2010digested peptides were allowed to have a maximum of four missed cleavages. Resulting PSMs were analysed using Percolator (v3.01), and an overall FDR cut\u2010off of 1% was applied.\nA custom python script was used to identify PSMs covering variant sites and showing either the variant or the canonical genotype. All initial candidate variant peptides had met the following criteria: (i) Mascot ion scores of at least 25; (ii) a Mascot delta score of at least 10; (iii) the peptide must only map to the variant database; (iv) the peptide must map to a single genomic position only; (v) for missense variants, the peptide must either show the variant amino acid or it must be cleaved according to a novel protease cleavage site arising from the variant; and (vi) for nonsense variants, the peptide must end at the novel C\u2010terminus. For canonical genotypes, the same criteria were applied except: (i) at least one protein the peptide maps to must not be from the variant database; (ii) for missense variants, the peptide must show the wild\u2010type amino acid; and (iii) for nonsense variants, the end of the peptide must be after the novel C\u2010terminus (after nonsense variant sites). The resulting candidate peptides were mapped against UniProt using BLAST to exclude other obvious explanations. To further consolidate the variants peptides and to reduce false positives, peptide identification by MaxQuant was performed in parallel. The customized exomic variant database was searched using the same parameters used for Ensembl database searches described above. The list of candidate variant peptides for the spectra angle analysis required the identification by both Mascot and MaxQuant.\nIdentification of peptides translated from non\u2010coding regions\nA database of products from possible alternative translation initiation sites (aTIS) was constructed by searching the 5\u2032 UTR of GENCODE transcripts (v25) for putative alternative start codons and in silico translating these \u201cnovel coding sequences\u201d. This resulted in 474,991 aTIS \u201cproteins\u201d >\u00a06 amino acids. The lncRNA protein databases were generated by three\u2010frame\u2010translating the GENCODE (v25) lncRNA database, resulting in 29,524 sequences. The standard 29 tissue proteomics datasets were supplemented with two tissues for which only proteome data were available (bone marrow, pituitary gland); in total, 50 samples (including replicates of some organs) were searched against concatenated sequence collections comprising the aTIS and lncRNA databases, GENCODE (v25), UniProt (downloaded on 03 February 2017) and sample\u2010specific RNA\u2010Seq\u2010based databases using Mascot to identify peptides from known proteins. The search parameters were the same as described for the exome variant peptide identification. The resulting PSMs were processed using Percolator, and an overall FDR cut\u2010off of 1% was applied. A custom python script was used to identify PSMs from putative\u2010translated lncRNAs or aTIS the database. Candidate peptides had to meet the following criteria: (i) the PSM must map to a single database only, i.e. aTIS or lncRNA but no any other; (ii) the Mascot score must be at least 25; (iii) the Mascot delta score must be at least 10; and (iv) the original underlying transcript must be expressed in at least one of the tissues (RNA\u2010Seq FPKM >\u00a01). The resulting PSMs were then mapped against UniProt using BLAST to exclude other explanations for the novel peptide (e.g. peptides arising from a novel tryptic cleavage site due to a genomic variant). To consolidate the list of candidate aTIS and lncRNA peptides and to reduce false positives, the raw MS data were also searched by MaxQuant (using the same parameters as described for searches using Ensembl). Only those peptides were allowed to pass to the stage of spectral contrast angle analysis if they were identified by both Mascot and MaxQuant.\nValidation of variant and non\u2010coding peptides by synthetic reference peptides\nAll peptides which passed the filter criteria for Mascot described above were synthesized at JPT Berlin using Fmoc\u2010based solid\u2010phase synthesis. The details of peptide synthesis, sample preparation and MS measurement were as described (Zolg et\u00a0al, 2017). Normalized spectral contrast angle (SA) analysis was performed to compare endogenous and synthetic peptides using in\u2010house Python scripts (Toprak et\u00a0al, 2014). Candidates passed if (i) they showed SA values of \u2265\u00a00.7 (Pearson of ~0.9), (ii) the endogenous peptide had a Mascot score of 50 or higher or (iii) manual spectrum inspection substantiated the candidate peptide sequence assignment. In parallel, the tandem MS spectra of all candidate peptides were also inspected manually. For the identification of \u201cmissing proteins\u201d, we required an Andromeda score of \u2265\u00a0100. The other criteria were the same as above.",
