    "TITLE": "Building ProteomeTools based on a complete synthetic human proteome",
    "ABSTRACT": "The ProteomeTools project builds molecular and digital tools from the human proteome to facilitate biomedical and life science research. Here, we report the generation and multimodal LC-MS/MS analysis of >330,000 synthetic tryptic peptides representing essentially all canonical human gene products and exemplify the utility of this data. The resource will be extended to >1 million peptides and all data will be shared with the community via ProteomicsDB and proteomeXchange.",
    "INTRO": "Proteomic research greatly relies on the mass spectrometric and bioinformatic analysis of proteolytic digests of complex protein mixtures to infer protein identity and quantity. Albeit very powerful, there are technical and conceptual limitations in commonly followed approaches that make the measurement of complete proteomes very challenging. In part, this is due to the vast molecular complexity of proteomes that arises from e.g. gene expression, splicing of mRNAs or post-translational modification of proteins. As a result, the precise composition of a proteome is essentially always unknown. In addition, the measurement of protease digested proteomes by mass spectrometry creates large quantities of spectra of varying quality. The computational tools used in the field all make assumptions as to the presumed content of a proteome by matching mass spectra to peptides and to infer proteins. The statistical methods applied invariably represent compromises in terms of the sensitivity and specificity with which proteins are identified from complex mixtures. In analytical chemistry, verifying the identity of a molecule with certainty often makes use of synthetic reference standards. However, in proteome research the generation or use of such standards is only beginning to be implemented systematically. To facilitate this, we have embarked on a project termed ProteomeTools (Fig. 1) in which we aim to synthesize ~1.4 million individual peptides to cover all human proteins. Here, we report on the synthesis and multimodal LC-MS/MS analysis of >330,000 synthetic tryptic peptides covering essentially all canonical human proteins as annotated in Swissprot. Peptides were chosen either based on their experimentally determined proteotypicity or by brute force (all peptides within the typical mass range of a mass spectrometer) for hitherto unobserved proteins or those with little prior experimental evidence. We also included a subset of peptides of the Human SRMAtlas (Supplementary Table 1). As more data on the use of alternative proteases become available, such peptides (~300,000) will be systematically incorporated into the project to increase spectral and sequence coverage for any given protein. Another 200,000 peptides are earmarked for protein sequence variants such as protein isoforms or important natural or pathological variants. A substantial part (~350,000) of the capacity will be devoted to post-translationally modified peptides such as phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitinylation and mono-glycosylation. While some of these peptides may be synthetically more challenging, their impact will likely be high as they represent the result of enzymatic activity that often modulates the function of proteins. Finally, we are reserving 200,000 peptides to represent other interesting biology such as disease associated mutations, HLA neo-antigens, protease cleavage products, small open reading frames or translated lincRNAs (Fig. 1a).\nTryptic peptides were individually synthesized, combined into pools of ~1,000 peptides and spiked with 66 non-naturally occurring and 15 stable isotope labeled peptides for retention time calibration. Whenever possible, we designed pools such that peptides do not have identical masses to avoid ambiguity in the mass spectrometric data or cover the entire LC gradient (Supplementary Figure 1). Each pool was subjected to an initial LC-MS/MS analysis using HCD and CID fragmentation on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer in order to determine which peptides were successfully synthesized, to determine their chromatographic retention times (RT) and compute retention time indices (iRT; Supplementary Figure 2). For each peptide pool, an inclusion list was generated to target peptides for fragmentation in further LC-MS experiments using five different fragmentation methods (HCD, CID, ETD, ETHCD, ETCID) with ion trap or Orbitrap readout and HCD spectra were recorded at 6 different collision energies (Supplementary Figures 3\u20137). Peptides ranged from 7 to 40 amino acids in length and up to 96 % of these could be detected by LC-MS/MS in individual pools (78 % average recovery, Supplementary Figure 8\u20139). Using the open modification search option of MaxQuant/Andromeda, we were able to assess the side product profile to estimate the approximate yield of each peptide by measuring the percentage of the total MS signal that can be attributed to the target peptide sequence (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Figure 10). As expected, the purity of the synthesized peptides varied and many of the chemical by-products correspond to incompletely removed protection groups or missing amino acids. The presence of by-products turned out to be useful as truncated peptides provided additional evidence for the presence of the correct full length peptide. They may in the future also serve to refine retention time and fragmentation prediction or to identify some of the many good quality spectra that remain unidentified in typical proteomic experiments.\nOne important goal of the project is to generate reference mass spectra for the identification and quantification of human peptides and proteins. At an arbitrarily high Andromeda score cut-off of 100, indicating very high spectral quality, we obtained a total of 11.3 million peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) mapping to 211,895 peptides and covering each gene by a median of 9 peptides (Fig. 1c). The median precursor intensity fraction (PIF; i.e. the fraction of the precursor signal vs. the total signal selected for fragmentation) was 92%, indicating that the spectra of most peptides are largely free of other contaminating peptides. Very high quality tandem mass spectra were obtained for all eleven tandem MS methods used but with varying degrees of proteome coverage. Analysis of the Andromeda search engine score distribution (Fig. 1d) showed that the 211,895 peptides (peptide FDR <0.002%) led to the identification of 19,735 of the 20,036 human genes deposited in Swissprot thus providing very high quality reference spectra for 98.5% of the human proteome (Supplementary Table 2). The remaining genes/proteins often contain proline-rich repeats or retroviral sequences that cannot be covered by tryptic peptides of reasonable length. Some of these may eventually be covered when synthesizing peptides using other digestion enzyme specificities. As an interesting side note, because of considerable protein sequence conservation between the human and mouse proteomes, the peptide library also contains 60,961 (proteotypic) peptides covering 12,599 (77%) unique mouse genes, thus considerably expanding the scope and utility of these peptides (Supplementary Table 3; Supplementary Notes).\nOne obvious use of synthetic peptide reference spectra is to confirm identifications of rarely (or newly) observed proteins. At the time of writing, there were only two spectra in ProteomicsDB supporting the identification of the same peptide of Aquaporin 12B with identification Q-scores different from the target-decoy distributions using the \u2018picked\u2019 target-decoy approach (Fig. 2a). The mirror plot showing the ion trap spectrum of the endogenous peptide and the corresponding spectrum of the synthetic peptide indicates very good agreement thus validating the identification of this protein from a single peptide.\nWe recorded HCD spectra at six different normalized collision energies with the aim to identify conditions for the measurement of peptides by targeted assays such as SRM, PRM or SWATH. To evaluate if HCD spectra obtained in this study are suitable for this purpose, we compared our data to ~9,000 peptides from a SWATH spectral library built from proteome digests acquired on a QTOF instrument. The analysis shows that there is very high correlation between the two types of data (R>0.9) and that spectra with poor correlation may represent false positives in the SWATH spectral library (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Figure 11).\nAs an example to illustrate the usefulness of the data for developing software, we built a prototype classifier based on multiple HCD spectra for the same peptide at a particular collision energy. This classifier predicts the fragment ion intensity of tandem mass spectra of any peptide with Pearson correlation coefficients of around 0.9 (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Figures 12\u201314). Such tools may complement or eventually replace experimental data for the development of SRM/PRM/SWATH assays or facilitate the transfer of data recorded on a discovery proteomics instrument to an assay instrument. We consciously decided not to synthesize stable isotope encoded peptides for this project because their fragmentation spectra can be easily simulated based on spectra of the unlabeled version. It is also economically more efficient to create heavy peptides tailored to the project at hand. However, we are in the process of measuring peptides following chemical derivatization by tandem mass tags (TMT) and di-methyl labeling to cover the most commonly used stable isotope labeling methods.\nAn important aspect of the project is to enable and engage the proteomics community and this will be done in a number of ways. We encourage the community to propose sets of peptides to include in the project. Our stocks contain 100 clones of the peptide library which can be handed out to research groups willing to generate data on alternative mass spectrometric platforms such as QTOF instruments, ion mobility devices or different chromatographic systems. All of the current data is available in proteomeXchange and ProteomicsDB and we will do the same for all upcoming data to engage the bioinformatics community to enable re-use and re-analysis of what we believe is a valuable resource.\nThe tryptic peptides reported here are only the beginning of the project and many further uses of the information generated can be envisaged. We plan to release new data every six months (~250,000 peptides per release) so that the community can access this data while the project progresses. As the physical reagents are finite resources, the long term value of the work lies in the data. It should be valuable for the development of software tools that may include intelligent data acquisition routines within the instrument control software or the development of more powerful database or spectral library search engines utilizing e.g. concepts of machine learning. There is also still a need to develop improved statistical tools for the assessment of large-scale proteomic experiments particularly for data independent measurements such as SWATH or SRM/PRM. The spectral libraries generated in this project should provide ample opportunity to facilitate these applications. Reagents and software aside, we also plan to build targeted assays in the next two years for sets of functionally important proteins such as kinases and phosphopeptides representing the activation status of signaling pathways. The results obtained so far demonstrate that the overall project is conceptually and technically feasible and yield scientifically meaningful and interesting results. We are therefore confident that the molecular and digital tools arising from the ProteomeTools project will become a valuable resources for the proteomics community in the future.",
