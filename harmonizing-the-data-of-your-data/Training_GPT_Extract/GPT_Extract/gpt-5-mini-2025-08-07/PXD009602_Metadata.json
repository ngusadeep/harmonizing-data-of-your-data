    "Comment[EnrichmentMethod]": [
      "HLA-class I and II molecules were isolated by immunoaffinity purification using the panHLA-class I monoclonal antibody W6/32, the HLA-DR monoclonal antibody L243 and the panHLA-class II monoclonal antibody Tü39 (all produced in-house). Separate purification of HLA-class I and II ligands was performed eluting peptides with 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid."
